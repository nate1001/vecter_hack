<p><a id="cost" name="cost"></a><a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>Tools
are listed above by category. The COST field denotes the base price
of each item. WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1). The
existence of some items depends on options chosen when the program
was compiled; they are noted with an asterisk (<a id="ast"
name="ast"></a>*).</p>

<p><a id="prob" name="prob"></a>Tools comprise 8% of all
randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 0% in containers, 0%
on the Rogue level, and 12% in hell. PROB is the relative
probability of each subtype. See below for more details on item
generation.</p>

<p><a id="chg" name="chg"></a>If the CHG field is not blank, then
the tool can be charged by a scroll of charging or the Platinum
Yendorian Express Card. The number shows the maximum number of
initial charges. An exclamation mark (<a id="excl"
name="excl"></a>!) indicates that the tool can only be recharged
once.</p>

<p><a id="appearance" name="appearance"></a>Finally, some items
have a different APPEARANCE until they are identified. Note that
many tools share the same appearance with other types of tools.</p>

<h2><a id="containers" name="containers"></a>Using containers</h2>

<p>Containers are generated uncursed, with the CONTENTS described
below. Containers will not be generated containing tools, weapons,
armour or rocks. Containers in your initial inventory will be
empty. If the container can be LOCKED, then there is an 80% chance
that it will be generated locked and a different 10% chance that it
will be trapped. Not all containers FIT into other containers. Some
containers have special EFFECTS. All of the containers except ice
boxes can be eaten by gelatinous cubes; the contents will be
engulfed but unharmed.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics may carry a large box containing either a live
or dead housecat named Schroedinger's Cat. The state of the cat is
not determined until the box is opened. There is nothing special
about this cat; it is just a silly physics joke.</p>

<p>The weight of a bag of holding (wgt) -- including the 15 for the
bag itself -- depends on the weight of its contents (cwgt) and its
blessed status:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7"
summary="Bags of holding and weight reduction">
<tr>
<td>blessed</td>
<td>wgt = 15 + cwgt/4 + 1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>uncursed</td>
<td>wgt = 15 + cwgt/2 + 1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>cursed</td>
<td>wgt = 15 + cwgt*2</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You may also lose items when you use a cursed bag of holding;
each item in the bag has a 1/13 chance of disappearing each time
you apply or loot the bag.</p>

<p>Putting any of the following (and ONLY the following) items into
any bag of holding will cause it to explode:</p>

<ul>
<li>(another) bag of holding</li>

<li>bag of tricks (with non-zero charge)</li>

<li>wand of cancellation (with non-zero charge)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is sometimes possible to put one of these items into nested
sacks and/or oilskin sacks and then place them safely inside a bag
of holding. The chance of an explosion occurring then depends on
the amount of nesting:</p>

<table summary="Odds of nesting bags of holding" border="1"

<th>sacks</th>

<p>When a bag of tricks is #looted, it will bite you (1 to 10 hit
points damage) and become identified. If you (a)pply it and it has
charges left, it will create one monster 22 out of 23 times, and
create 2 to 8 monsters 1 out of 23 times. "Nothing happens" when
you apply a bag with zero charges. Bags of tricks are generated
with 1 to 20 charges. If the bag has more than 10 charges, a
blessed scroll of charging will add 5 to 10 charges, otherwise it
will add 10 to 15 charges; an uncursed scroll will always add 1 to
5 charges. Cannot be charged higher than 50 charges.</p>

<p>When ungreased bags get wet, their contents may also get wet. A
non-cursed oilskin sack will prevent this; if the oilskin sack is
cursed, there is a 1/3 chance that the contents can get wet. Boxes
and chests are all waterproof.</p>

<h2><a id="unlocking" name="unlocking"></a>Using unlocking
tools</h2>

<p>Each of the tools, wands, and spells listed below can be used
for locking and unlocking doors, large boxes, and chests. Not all
methods can LOCK or UNLOCK. DOOR and BOX represent the probability
(in percent) of succeeding each turn when attempting to unlock
doors and large boxes or chests respectively; it may be based on
your Dexterity and you will fail after 50 turns. ROGUEs may get an
additional percentile bonus for using an implement (the numbers
before and after the slash being added to DOOR/BOX respectively).
The per-turn probability of picking the lock is halved if you use a
cursed credit card, lock pick, or skeleton key. All unlocking tools
are generated uncursed.</p>

<p>Using any of the first three types will exercise your dexterity,
even if you don't succeed. Please note that a credit card has no
special effects in shops, although you can unlock a shop "Closed
for inventory" and you can buy and sell it like any other item. If
a watchman or watch captain sees you pick a door with any tool, he
may get upset; if he warns you off, a trap is automatically added
to the door in question.</p>

<p>Wands of opening and locking and the spells of knock and wizard
lock always work in one turn and can be performed from a distance.
Zapped opening will also unlock doors in the same turn, will lower
drawbridges, and can remove a ball and chain (as will ringing the
blessed Bell of Opening). Zapped closing will close a door in the
same turn (if there are no objects in the way; creating one if
necessary) and will raise drawbridges.</p>

<p>You can also attempt to break a lock on a large box or chest by
#forcing it with a suitable weapon or kicking it open. This may
EXERCISE your dexterity or strength, but may also destroy any
WEAPON you use, the CONTAINER and/or some of the CONTENTS (possibly
restricted to fragile ones, namely glass items (other than
worthless glass) and eggs):</p>

<p>Candles can also be applied to the Candelabrum of Invocation.
Brass lanterns and oil lamps can be refilled by a scroll of
charging; a blessed scroll will refill them to 1500 turns, an
uncursed scroll will add 750 turns to a maximum of 1500. Oil lamps
can also be refilled with potions of oil, getting twice of the
remaining turns in the potion of oil. No lamp can be filled beyond
1500 turns.</p>

<p>The artifact weapon Sunsword will act as a light source whenever
wielded, either by you or by a monster.</p>

<p>If you wish for a magic lamp, you will instead get an ordinary
oil lamp.</p>

<p>Magic lamps never run out of power, and may summon a djinni and
lead to a wish when #rubbed. Each time you rub the lamp, there is a
1/3 chance that "You see a puff of smoke" and another 1/3 chance
that "Nothing happens"; in either case, just try again.</p>

<p>The remaining 1/3 of the time a djinni appears, the lamp is
identified and turned into an oil lamp, and one of five outcomes
can occur. The relative chance of these outcomes depends on whether
the lamp was blessed, uncursed, or cursed:</p>

can also be a)pplied.</p>

<h3><a id="trap" name="trap"></a>beartrap or land mine</h3>

<p>If you successfully #untrap one of these traps, the trap becomes
a tool. You can pick up the tool and later re-arm the trap at your
current location by (a)pplying the tool.</p>

<h3>bullwhip</h3>

<p>This weapon can also be applied to get yourself out of a pit,
unwield or steal another monster's weapon, hit a monster, whip your
steed into a gallop, or grab objects off the floor while
levitating.</p>

<h3><a id="pick-axe" name="pick-axe"></a>pick-axe</h3>

<p>You can dig by (a)pplying a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock.

direction to dig through rock, walls, or doors, or to smash up
statues or boulders.</p>

<h3>axe or battle-axe</h3>

<p>These weapons can also be applied to chop down doors or

<p>You can apply this food item to blind yourself for 1 to 25
turns.</p>

<h3>eucalyptus leaf</h3>

<p><strong>non-blessed</strong>
<br />
 Acts like a tin whistle (see instruments, above).</p>

<p><strong>blessed</strong>

use has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf.</p>

<h3><a id="grappling_hook" name="grappling_hook"></a>grappling
hook</h3>

<p>You can apply this tool to grab an object at a distance, hit a
monster (or, if small, drag it towards you), drag yourself in a
direction, or hit yourself for 10 to 19 points of damage. If you
are at least skilled in flail, you can attempt to choose between
the first three options (with a 50% chance of accuracy if skilled,
95% if expert); otherwise, the effect will be randomly chosen.</p>

<p><strong>cursed</strong>
<br />
 You get one of the following: illness, blindness, confusion,
stunning, hallucination, or a decremented attribute.</p>

<p>Unicorn horns don't fix stoning, sliming, strangulation, or
wounded legs. #dipping a unicorn horn in a potion of blindness,
confusion, or hallucination turns the potion into uncursed water.
Dipping it in a potion of sickness produces non-blessed fruit
juice.</p>

<p>Unicorn horns also make a fairly good weapon. They are
two-handed.</p>

<h3><a id="expensive_camera" name="expensive_camera">expensive
camera</a></h3>

<p>Generated with 29 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging
will add 5 to 14 charges, and then bring the camera to a minimum of
50 charges. A blessed scroll of charging will add 10 to 25 charges,
and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between
51 and 74). A camera may never have more than 127 charges.</p>

<p>You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
situations.</p>

<p>A cursed camera has a 50% chance of blinding you when
applied.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can blind monsters.</p>

<h3><a id="mirror" name="mirror">mirror</a></h3>

<p>Cursed mirrors only work half of the time.</p>

<p>You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
situations (especially hallucinating; try underwater or at yourself
while polymorphed into a floating eye).</p>

<p>You can use a mirror to make a monster's gaze attacks work
against itself (if the monster isn't cancelled):</p>

<p>Otherwise, you have a 4 out of 5 chance of scaring the monster
in that direction for 2 to 8 turns. The monster cannot be a unicorn
or humanoid, must have eyes and be unblind, and must be able to see
invisible if it is invisible.</p>

<p>Breaking any mirror (except by kicking a container) carries a -2
penalty to luck.</p>

<h3><a id="crystal_ball" name="crystal_ball">crystal ball</a></h3>

<p>Generated 1/4 blessed, 1/2 uncursed, 1/4 cursed.</p>

<p>Generated with 1 to 5 charges. (If your Quest Artifact is a
crystal ball,it is always generated with 5 charges. Blessed scrolls
of charging set the ball to 6 charges. Uncursed scrolls of charging
add one charge, to a maximum of 5.</p>

<p>Applying a crystal ball will cause you to be immobile (in a
trance) for 1 to 10 turns.</p>

<p>There are several humorous messages if used when
hallucinating.</p>

<p><strong>non-cursed</strong>
<br />
 You may look for an object, monster or symbol (including traps and
portals, ^, but not stairs or other dungeon features). There is an
(intelligence in 20) chance of success; otherwise, you suffer the
same effects as a cursed crystal ball.</p>

<p><strong>cursed</strong>
<br />
 One of the following happens: nothing, you are confused, you are
blinded, you hallucinate, or the ball explodes (not if an
artifact).</p>

<h3><a id="lenses" name="lenses">lenses</a></h3>

<p>These protect you from being blinded by ravens, spat venom or
thrown cream pies. They increase the effectiveness of searching,
and reduce the failure rate and time taken to learn spells from
spellbooks.</p>

<h3><a id="blindfold" name="blindfold">blindfold</a></h3>

<p>You can controllably blind yourself by (a)pplying it or
(P)utting it on. A cursed blindfold cannot be removed by
yourself.</p>

<h3><a id="towel" name="towel">towel</a></h3>

<p>You can controllably blind yourself (like a blindfold) by
(P)utting it on. A cursed towel cannot be removed by yourself.</p>

<p>When (a)pplied, a towel can clean greasy hands (e.g., from a tin
of greasy food) or clean a cream pie off your face. A cursed towel
has a 1/3 chance of causing each of these problems, or else it
works normally.</p>

<p>If you (E)ngrave with a towel, you can rub out writing in the
dust.</p>

<h3><a id="saddle" name="saddle">saddle</a></h3>

<p>You can (a)pply it to a monster (equines, quadrupeds, dragons,
jabberwocks, ki-rin or couatls) in order to be able to ride it in
future. Chance of successfully saddling depends on dexterity,
charisma, tameness of monster and riding skill; Knights receive a
bonus, as does wearing riding boots or gloves.</p>

<h3><a id="leash" name="leash">leash</a></h3>

<p>You can (a)pply it to a tame monster to keep it nearby. Once you
have leashed a monster, you can release it by re-(a)pplying the
leash. A cursed leash can't be removed by yourself, and moving too
far from your pet may cause it to be choked and take damage.</p>

<h3><a id="stethoscope" name="stethoscope">stethoscope</a></h3>

<p>A stethoscope can be (a)pplied once each turn without taking any
time. If you use it more than that, each application takes one
turn.</p>

<p>You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
situations.</p>

<p>A cursed stethoscope has a 50% chance of only hearing your own
heartbeat.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can use it to find the status of adjacent
monsters or of yourself or your steed, and find secret doors and
passages.</p>

<h3><a id="tinning_kit" name="tinning_kit">tinning kit</a></h3>

<p>Created with 29 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging
will add 5 to 14 charges, and then bring the kit to a minimum of 50
charges. A blessed scroll of charging will add 10 to 25 charges,
and then bring the kit to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between 51
and 74). A tinning kit may never have more than 127 charges.</p>

<p>You can convert corpses into tins. The corpse must be uneaten
and have non-zero nutrition. The resulting tin is
blessed/uncursed/cursed the same way as the tinning kit that
produced it. Blessed tins are not poisonous or rotten, and can be
opened in one turn. Cursed tins always contain rotten food. Tins
have the same chance of giving an intrinsic as the equivalent
corpse; the blessed/cursed status of the tin does NOT affect the
chance.</p>

<p>Some people tin unique monsters as souvenirs. You cannot tin the
endgame Riders.</p>

<h3><a id="tin_opener" name="tin_opener">tin opener</a></h3>

<p>Mostly useless. Wield the tin opener and you can e)at a tin in
one turn.</p>

<h3><a id="can_of_grease" name="can_of_grease">can of
grease</a></h3>

<p>Generated 5% blessed, 90% uncursed, 5% cursed.</p>

<p>Created with 1 to 25 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed
scrolls of charging add 5 to 10 charges, otherwise 10 to 15
charges. Uncursed scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges. Cannot be
charged higher than 50 charges.</p>

<p>When a)pplying a can of grease, you have a 50% chance of
dropping it if it is cursed or you have fumbling. Otherwise, you
can grease an item to prevent it from rusting or corroding. If the
can of grease is cursed or you specify no object, you get your
fingers greasy.</p>

<p>Greased outer body armour will protect against grabbing attacks,
and greased helmets will protect against (master) mind flayer's
tentacles; however, the grease has a 50% chance of wearing off
after each attack against which it protects, and grease on cursed
armour will only be effective 1/3 of the time.</p>

<p>You can also use the can of grease or a potion of oil to #untrap
a squeaky board.</p>

<h3><a id="figurine" name="figurine">figurine</a></h3>

<p>Generated 1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 cursed.</p>

<p>Applying a figurine creates that monster in an adjacent square
of your choosing. It will fail if the square is occupied, or if the
species is genocided. The chance of a tame or peaceful monster
depends on the blessed state of the figurine:</p>

<h3><a id="magic_marker" name="magic_marker">magic marker</a></h3>

<p>Generated with 29 to 99 charges. Can only be recharged once.</p>

<p>An uncursed scroll of charging will add 5 to 14 charges, and
then bring the marker to a minimum of 50 charges. A blessed scroll
of charging will add 10 to 25 charges, and then bring the marker to
a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between 51 and 74).</p>

hiding and invisible monsters.</p>

<p><strong>cursed</strong>

<br />
 Else you summon undead and wake nearby monsters.</p>

<h3><a id="Candelabrum_of_Invocation"
name="Candelabrum_of_Invocation"></a>Candelabrum of Invocation</h3>

<p>Obtained from Vlad the Impaler.</p>

<p><strong>blessed or uncursed</strong>
<br />
 The Candelabrum acts like an ordinary light source if at least one
candle is applied to it. It will last as many turns as the first
candle that was applied would have burned.</p>

<p><strong>cursed</strong>
<br />
 The Candelabrum won't light.</p>

<h3>Book of the Dead</h3>

<p>Obtained from the Wizard of Yendor.</p>

<p><strong>blessed</strong>
<br />
 Undead creatures in your sight are made peaceful; nearby ones
sharing your alignment may be tamed, others may flee.</p>

vibrating square and have the non-cursed Candelabrum of Invocation
with seven candles attached (the candles can be any type(s), and
even cursed), the non-cursed Bell of Opening with at least one
charge, and the non-cursed Book of the Dead. The Candelabrum burns
out twice as fast when on the vibrating square. The Bell must be
rung within 5 turns before the invocation. The Book must be read
last. Sascha Wostmann described a good way to remember the
sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make some light, to read by.</li>

<li>Ring the bell, to get the attention of an audience.</li>

<li>Finally, read the book.</li>
