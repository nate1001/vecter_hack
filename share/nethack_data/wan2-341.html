<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Jeffrey Robertson.)</p>

<p>You can destroy a wand by (a)pplying it. You will be prompted
for confirmation, and you must have hands and a strength of at
least 10. Wands with no charges and some wands listed below have no
effect ("But nothing else happens...").</p>

<p>Most wands will produce an explosion when broken. The explosion
causes damage to yourself and any monsters that were in the
adjacent squares when you broke the wand. This damage can be
reduced or eliminated if you (or the monster) has an appropriate
resistance. Damage is also reduced to 1/2 for Healers and Knights
and to 1/5 for Monks, Priests and Wizards. Further effects can
occur as if you had zapped yourself with the wand. The explosion
can also affect objects in your inventory, on your square, and on
adjacent squares, and affect locations as if they were zapped.
Finally, some types of wands have explosions that make you identify
the wand.</p>

<p>Specific effects are detailed below. In any case, you destroy
the wand and owe the cost if it was unpaid.</p>

<h2><a id="cancelling" name="cancelling">Cancelling</a></h2>

<p>(Adapted from the spoiler "cancel", by Boudewijn Waijers.)</p>

<p>Monsters (including you) can be cancelled when hit by wands or
spells of cancellation, and sometimes by Magicbane. The monster may
resist. Also, when a gremlin (including you) manages to steal an
intrinsic from a monster, the monster is automatically cancelled as
well. Cancelled monsters cannot use most of their special attacks
against you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blind you with light</li>

<li>Cast spells at you</li>

<li>Charm you</li>

<li>Confuse you</li>

<li>Drain your constitution</li>

<li>Drain your dexterity</li>

<li>Explode in your face</li>

<li>Paralyse you</li>

<li>Poison you</li>

<li>Put you to sleep</li>

<li>Rust, rot or disenchant something, offensive or defensive</li>

<li>Seduce you</li>

<li>Slime you</li>

<li>Slow you down</li>

<li>Spit at you</li>

<li>Steal an item (other than the Unique Items)</li>

<li>Steal intrinsics</li>

<li>Steal your gold</li>

<li>Stun you</li>

<li>Teleport you away</li>

<li>Use a wand of make invisible on itself</li>

<li>Use acid offensively against you</li>

<li>Use its breath weapon</li>

<li>Use its cold attack, offensive or defensive</li>

<li>Use its electricity attack, offensive or defensive</li>

<li>Use its fire attack or gaze, offensive or defensive</li>

<li>Wrap itself around you</li>
</ul>

<p>Many monsters also lose abilities specific to their species as
well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medusa's gaze cannot turn you to stone</li>

<li>Medusa cannot be turned to stone with a reflecting item</li>

<li>A black or brown pudding cannot divide</li>

<li>A clay golem will die</li>

<li>A chickatrice or cockatrice can't turn you to stone by
hissing</li>

<li>A demon cannot summon other demons</li>

<li>A floating eye cannot be paralysed with a mirror</li>

<li>A lycanthrope cannot change you into another one</li>

<li>A lycanthrope cannot summon help</li>

<li>A lycanthrope cannot polymorph into their wereform by
attacking</li>

<li>A mimic cannot revert to mimicking an object</li>

<li>A nurse won't heal you with its attack</li>

<li>A nymph or succubus won't steal your mirror if you apply
it</li>

<li>A tengu cannot teleport</li>

<li>An umber hulk cannot be confused with a mirror</li>

<li>A xan's prick doesn't weaken you</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some attacks aren't susceptible to cancellation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Defensive acid splashing</li>

<li>Disease attacks</li>

<li>Famine's hunger attack</li>

<li>Mind-flaying attacks</li>

<li>Physical blinding attacks</li>

<li>Physical damage attacks</li>

<li>The Oracle's magic defences</li>

<li>Touch of Death</li>

<li>Wizard or Quest Nemesis stealing the Amulet, Bell, Book or
Candelabrum</li>
</ul>

<p>When a monster cannot use a certain attack on you, it normally
cannot use it on another monster either.</p>

<p>A wand or spell of cancellation will also affect objects on the
floor, or objects in your inventory if you zap yourself. However,
it does not affect other monster's inventories or the contents of
containers. Affected objects will always become uncursed. Specific
effects are described below:</p>

</table>

<p>Note that cancellation won't work on corpses; if it is
resurrected, the monster will still function exactly the same as if
the monster had not been cancelled when it was still alive.</p>

<h2><a id="polymorphing" name="polymorphing">Polymorphing</a></h2>

<p>You can use a wand or spell of polymorph on both monsters and
objects. The beam acts over a maximum distance of 6 to 13 squares,
and cannot be reflected. Polymorph traps may also affect monsters,
but not objects. Potions of polymorph can be quaffed to polymorph
yourself, thrown at a target, or used to dip an object into.
Quaffing from a sink has a 1/20 chance of polymorphing you.</p>

<p>When a monster (including you) is affected, the monster may
change into a different species. Magic resistance will prevent a
monster from polymorphing, unless the monster zapped itself (or
yourself). Some monsters may also resist the attack, as well. A
polymorphing monster has a 1/25 chance of dying of system shock,
unless it is a natural shapeshifter. Objects in the monster's or
your inventory are not affected, nor are objects dropped as a
result of the polymorph.</p>

<p>There are several special cases when you are polymorphed. If you
are wearing an amulet of unchanging, you will not polymorph. If you
have polymorph control, you can choose the creature you wish to be
polymorphed into. If you are wearing dragon armour, you will become
that type of dragon (unless you have polymorph control) and will
lose your cloak and shirt; the armour will merge with your skin and
be unharmed if not broken by a further polymorph. If you have
lycanthropy, you turn into that were-creature (or vice versa); if
you are a vampire, you become a vampire bat (or vice versa). If you
have none of the above, you have a (19 - Constitution) in 20 chance
of getting system shock ("You shudder for a moment", lose 1 to 30
HP, and abuse your constitution); if this does not occur, there is
a 1/5 chance (which also applies to controlled polymorphs) that you
become a "new man/woman/&lt;race&gt;" rather than a different
monster, and your level, hit points, energy, and statistics will be
randomly adjusted.</p>

<p>How long you are polymorphed depends on your experience level
and the level of the monster you became (this prevents abuse by
low-level characters); you will not revert while you have
unchanging. You can always return to your natural form by losing
all of your hit points (in a pinch by throwing objects upwards
(&lt;) and letting them hit you) unless you have unchanging; in
this case, you will simply die. Other monsters remain the same
species indefinitely (except true shapeshifters).</p>

<p>You can also polymorph objects. Many people call this
"polypiling", because they painstakingly collect items, line them
up into several piles, and polymorph them all at one. Each item may
become a new item in the same object class. The objects retain
their blessed/cursed state, erosion, erosionproofing, traps, and
poisoning. Wands keep their number of charges, whereas weapons and
armor keep their enchantment. Worn items are removed on
polymorphing. Magical objects will tend not to polymorph into
non-magical ones, and vice versa; the probabilities of this for the
object classes that have members of each kind are as below.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7"
summary="Chances of magical items polymorphing into non-magical items, and vice-versa">
<tr align="center">
<th>class</th>
<th>magical -&gt; non-magical</th>
<th>non-magical -&gt; magical</th>

<tr align="center">
<td align="left">armour</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>You will eventually lose some objects. Items appearing in
quantities of 2 or more have a (quantity in 1000) chance of merging
into one object. Items also have a probability of "shuddering": 1/3
if a wand or cursed, 1/8 if uncursed, 1/12 if blessed (if in
quantities greater than 4, 100%, 1/4, and 1/6, respectively). This
will decrease the quantity of the item randomly, cause any
remainder not to be polymorphed, and has a one in (luck + 45)
chance of creating a golem from the material of the shuddered item.
Scrolls of mail will never merge or shudder.</p>

<p>There are some limitations to polypiling. You can't change
scrolls of mail, wands of polymorph, potions of polymorph,
spellbooks of polymorph, Rider corpses, the invocation artifacts,
or the Amulet of Yendor. Artifacts have a much higher chance of
resisting polymorph than non-artifacts; the result of a polymorph
will never be an artifact. Eggs laid by you become other types of
eggs, still laid by you. Spellbooks will become more faded, wands
have their recharge count incremented. Magic markers will be
considered to have been recharged once. Crocodile corpses become
non-cursed fireproof +0 low boots. Containers lose all of their
contents. There are limits to converting stones (e.g. rocks and
luckstones) into gems and glass; you won't get more than four. Note
that balls and chains become (surprise!) balls and chains. You can
never create the following objects through polypiling:</p>

<ul>
<li>magic lamps</li>

<li>wands of wishing</li>

<li>wands of polymorph</li>

<li>potions of polymorph</li>

<li>spellbooks of polymorph</li>
</ul>

<p>and, since the probabilities of the new item are the same as for
random generation of that object class, you'll never get anything
you wouldn't find randomly created in the dungeon either.</p>
