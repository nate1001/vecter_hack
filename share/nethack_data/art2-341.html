<p>Magicbane has several special effects when wielded that make
this artifact a very useful item. It resists 95% of curses thrown
at you, gives magic resistance, and can engrave without dulling. As
a weapon, it may (depending on the monster's magic resistance
saving throw) add additional damage and magical effects.</p>

<!-- Converted by AscToTab 4.0 - fully registered version -->
<p><a id="mbenchant" name="mbenchant"></a>The above table describes
the probability that each of the magical effects will occur,
assuming that the monster does not successfully make any magic
resistance saving throws. The ENCHANTment of Magicbane affects
these probabilities; note that higher enchantments reduce the
likelihood of the better effects. (Negative enchantments have the
same probabilities as at +0.) <a id="mbnormal"
name="mbnormal"></a>Even the NORMAL, non-magical damage that occurs
60% of the time has an extra d4 damage above that of a normal
athame unless the monster resists. If any magical attacks occur, an
automatic extra d4 of damage is caused; the individual attacks have
further effects as follows.</p>

<p><a id="mbprobe" name="mbprobe"></a>The PROBE effect usually does
nothing special beyond adding the d4 for the magical effect; there
is a 1 in (3 * (absolute value of enchantment)) chance that the
probe is insightful, giving the effect of a wand of probing. A
probe is always insightful if Magicbane is at +0.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The magic-absorbing blade probes &lt;monster&gt;!"
<br />
 "The magic-absorbing blade prods &lt;monster&gt;!"
(hallucinating)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="mbstun" name="mbstun"></a>The STUN effect causes an
additional d4 of damage; if none of the later effects have occurred
and been successful, it stuns the monster (or you, for 3 (more)
turns, if you are being attacked by Magicbane).</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The magic-absorbing blade stuns &lt;monster&gt;!"
<br />
 "The magic-absorbing blade amazes &lt;monster&gt;!"
(hallucinating)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="mbscare" name="mbscare"></a>The SCARE effect scares the
monster for 3 (more) turns; the monster has a 50% chance of being
given an opportunity to resist. If you are being attacked by
Magicbane and aren't magic-resistant, this effect paralyses you for
3 (more) turns. There is also an additional d4 damage.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The magic-absorbing blade scares &lt;monster&gt;!"
<br />
 "The magic-absorbing blade tickles &lt;monster&gt;!"
(hallucinating)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="cancel" name="cancel"></a>Finally, the CANCEL effect
causes another additional d4 damage and has the same effect as a
spell of cancellation (but with a fixed level of 10 for resistance
saving throw purposes). If the monster has the ability to cast
spells, the effect adds one to your current and maximum spell
energy; the monster may resist. If you are hit with Magicbane and
you don't have magic-resistance, you are cancelled and lose one
current and maximum spell energy.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The magic-absorbing blade cancels &lt;monster&gt;!"
<br />
 "The magic-absorbing blade purges &lt;monster&gt;!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, any magical attack has a 1 in 12 chance of
confusing the defender.</p>

<p><a id="mbave" name="mbave"></a>The AVE DMG column in the table
above summarizes the expected average damage for each enchantment
level; it includes bonuses due to enchantment but not to weapon
skills (athames are in the dagger class). (Again, note that a
monster with a high base magic resistance saving throw may avert
magical effects, or reduce the severity of the effects that occur;
the quoted figures are for monsters with 0 MR.) The Damage row
lists the amount of damage each type of attack causes; the average
of each attack type is given in the Ave dmg row.</p>

<p>What is the best enchantment for Magicbane? If you simply want
to cause the most damage, then the table indicates that you should
enchant it as high as possible (safely to +7). Fortunately, your
odds of magic- resistance, curse-resistance, and engraving do not
depend upon the enchantment. However, if you want to maximize the
best magical effects of this artifact, it should be enchanted to
+2. Note that the only difference in the magical effects between
the +0 and the +2 Magicbane is a 3.7% change between probing and
stunning.</p>

<p>Magicbane is generally not the best weapon for combat, although
medium-level characters with good dagger skill and poor skills in
other weapon may find it their best choice. Higher-level characters
may want to wield it as their regular weapon to absorb curses while
they are travelling through the dungeon, switching to something
else to fight powerful monsters.</p>

<h2><a id="choose" name="choose"></a>Which artifact should I
choose?</h2>

<p>[Adapted from a spoiler courtesy of David Grabiner.]</p>

<p>If you get an early wish and decide to use it for a weapon, or
if you have accumulated several artifact weapons, which weapon you
should wield depends highly on your class because of the class
limits on weapon skills.</p>

<p>ARTIFACT weapons that are worth keeping are listed in the table
below. Some are artifacts are not listed, because they are only
effective against a small subset of monsters. The SKILL category of
each artifact is listed, as well as the maximum skill level for
each class (ABCHKMPRaRoSTVW): - means restricted to unskilled, b
means basic skill, s means skilled, and E means expert. Note that
if you receive an artifact as a gift by crowning or sacrificing,
any restriction on its weapon class will be removed and you will be
able to advance to basic skill.</p>

<p>The table also indicates the damage range of each artifact
against typical SMALL creatures, LARGE creatures, and major DEMONs.
The damage calculations assume that the artifact is enchanted as
shown, you have expert skill, and that the artifact's special
attacks apply to the monster; the Longbow of Diana assumes that you
are using normal +0 arrows fired at a rate of up to 4 a round
(expert Ranger). Damage against major demons further assumes that
the weapon is blessed and that the demon hates silver, is
fire-resistant, and is drain-resistant. Finally, the table
summarizes the average damage against major demons (DAVE), which
are often the nastiest creatures in the dungeon. Magicbane's actual
damage is slightly greater due to its special attacks, but it
doesn't make a difference here.</p>

<p>Six artifacts are particularly good all-purpose weapons and will
be considered further. Magicbane (MB) has several magical effects
(see section above) that make it a good weapon even though it
doesn't cause much damage. It works best when enchanted at +2, as
it loses its magical powers rapidly if you enchant it more.
Magicbane is also good if you don't have magic resistance or are
short of ways to remove curses. Stormbringer (SB) permanently
drains levels from monsters -- although some species are resistant,
including major demons -- and will attack tame or peaceful
creatures without confirmation, so it's bad if you're trying to
keep a pet. Excalibur (EX) is easy to get if you are lawful (dip a
long sword in a fountain), has automatic searching, and is a
somewhat effective weapon. Mjollnir (MJ) causes lightning damage,
and when thrown by a Valkyrie with strength 25, will usually return
to your hand. Being a hammer, it is good for classes who are
restricted from blades. Frost Brand (FB) causes cold damage, which
makes it an excellent all-around weapon. Although Fire Brand
similarly causes fire damage, most major demons are fire-resistant.
Finally, Grayswandir (GS) doubles most of its damage (working best
when fully enchanted) and causes silver damage. Even though
Grayswandir causes the most damage to major demons, Frost Brand is
slightly better against ordinary large monsters.</p>

<p>The table below compares these six artifacts for each character
CLASS. The EARLY GAME recommendation assumes that you will quickly
reach maximum skill in the weapon and that the weapon is enchanted
to +2, which might be expected from wishing or limited enchantment.
The LATE GAME recommendation assumes that you are maximally skilled
and that the weapon is enchanted as in the above table. If a weapon
is listed with a slash, this means that several are comparable and
the choice may depend on other factors. An artifact is listed in
parentheses if its skill starts as restricted; you will usually
want to obtain it or a weapon of its class as a divine gift in
order to unrestrict the skill before using it.</p>

<p>The weapons listed include any weapon which could reasonably be
the best for that class, as well as weapons which may be obtained
without a wish and which are close in quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Excalibur is a good weapon early in the game for lawful
characters, because it does almost as much damage as Frost Brand
and can be obtained without a wish; its lack of double damage makes
it inferior later, as Frost Brand's damage and strength bonuses
will be doubled.</li>

<li>The Staff of Aesculapius and the Tsurugi of Muramasa, Quest
Artifacts for Healers and Samurai, are powerful weapons; they have
the disadvantage of requiring two hands, but both do more damage
early in the game than any other available weapon. The Tsurugi
becomes inferior late in the game, because its damage bonus is not
doubled; the Staff is at a disadvantage in Gehennom because it will
lose its double damage against level-drain-resistant demons.</li>

<li>The Longbow of Diana, Quest Artifact for Rangers, is a highly
useful back-up weapon for fighting at a distance, but has the
disadvantage of extremely variable damage depending on the vagaries
of multiple shots, and the fact that the supply of arrows is
unenchanted.</li>

<p>It's interesting that Magicbane does so well early in the game;
this is a side effect of the weapon skills. Even for those classes
which don't have it listed, it's a good artifact to wish for
because it serves other useful purposes (magic resistance,
engraving, and curse resistance). It's a useful weapon to keep as
your main weapon after you have killed the Wizard; you can switch
to Frost Brand when a lot of nasties appear, because Magicbane
takes a long time to kill them, and powerful creatures will resist
Magicbane's special attacks.</p>
