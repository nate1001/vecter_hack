<p>Many attack spells have their damage affected by your experience
level (XL) and your INTelligence, according to modifiers referred
to in the following descriptions as 'spell damage' and 'spell
bonus'.</p>

<p>spell damage = (XL/2) +1</p>

<table summary="damage bonuses for spells" border="1"
cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td>if INT &lt; 10:</td>

<tr>

<p>Each spell is annotated with its school and its type. NODIR
spells do not ask for a direction. BEAM spells ask for a direction,
but do not show a visibly animated effect when cast. RAY spells
produce a beam which is animated on the screen. DISTANT spells ask
for a position at which to cast the spell. BEAM and RAY spells
cannot be aborted; if you try to cancel them at the direction
prompt, "The magical energy is released!" in the direction in which
you last took an action (possibly towards yourself).</p>

<p>Monsters are not angered by spells of dig, knock, (extra)
healing, stone to flesh (except stone golems), turn undead (if not
undead and none of their inventory was affected), or wizard lock;
being zapped (or missed by) other spells will cause peaceful
monsters to become hostile.</p>

<h3><a id="cancellation" name="cancellation">cancellation</a>
(matter, BEAM)</h3>

</blockquote>

<h3><a id="cause_fear" name="cause_fear">cause fear</a>
(enchantment, NODIR)</h3>

<p>Same effect as reading an uncursed scroll of scare monster.
<br />
 You will cause monsters within your visual range to flee. Some
monsters can resist the effect.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You hear maniacal laughter close by." (something was affected)
<br />
 "You hear maniacal laughter in the distance." (no creature
affected)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a id="charm" name="charm">charm monster</a> (enchantment,
NODIR)</h3>

<p>Same effect as reading an uncursed scroll of taming.
<br />
 Tames monsters within a one square radius. Also calms shopkeepers.
<br />
 Some monsters can resist.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">

</blockquote>

<h3><a id="clairvoyance" name="clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>
(divination, NODIR)</h3>

<p>You immediately map a rectangle around you up to 12 rows by 20
columns.
<br />
 Clairvoyance can be blocked.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You sense a pointy hat on top of your &lt;head&gt;." (if
wearing cornuthaum and not a Wizard)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a id="cold" name="cold">cone of cold</a> (attack,
RAY/DISTANT)</h3>

<p><strong>unskilled or basic</strong>
<br />
 Same effect as a wand of cold.</p>

<p><strong>zap monster</strong>
<br />
 The location of the monster is revealed, if unseen.
<br />
 If monster is cold resistant, no effect.
<br />
 Otherwise, does spell damage to (6 * spell damage) damage, plus
damage bonus. It does an additional spell damage to (3 * spell
damage) damage if the monster is fire resistant. This damage is all
doubled if you are a Knight with the Magic Mirror of Merlin. Some
monsters may resist and take half damage.
<br />
 Potions in the monster's inventory may be destroyed.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The cone of cold rips into the &lt;monster&gt;." (if swallowed)
<br />
 "The cone of cold hits the &lt;monster&gt;." (otherwise)</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>zap location</strong>
<br />

<blockquote class="dl">

<br />
 "The moat is bridged with ice!" (moat, in sight)
<br />
 "You hear a crackling sound." (water, out of sight)
<br />
 "The water freezes for a moment." (Plane of Water, in sight)
<br />
 "You hear a soft crackling." (Plane of Water, out of sight)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If lava, it solidifies.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The lava cools and solidifies." (lava, in sight)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If closed door, it is destroyed. The ray is halted.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The door freezes and shatters!" (in sight)
<br />
 "You feel cold." (otherwise)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>skilled or expert</strong>
<br />
 You may choose a location at which to cast explosions of cold.
This location may be no more than 10 squares away, and must be in
sight and open space. This spell cannot be used underwater or on
the Plane of Water; if used while swallowed, it is automatically
cast on your own location.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Your mind fails to lock onto that location!" (out of sight)
<br />
 "The spell dissipates over the distance!" (too far)
<br />
 "You're joking! In this weather?" (underwater)
<br />

Water)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 to 9 explosions follow; the first is centred at the location
you chose, subsequent ones randomly at any of the nine squares
around that point (unless swallowed). Each explosion affects the
surrounding squares, as above; monsters and yourself will take
spell damage plus damage bonus damage if not cold resistant (some
monsters may resist and take half damage); this damage is doubled
for fire resistant monsters. Potions in inventories may be
destroyed.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"&lt;Monster&gt; is caught in the ball of cold!"
<br />
 "You are caught in the ball of cold!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any explosions that would be centred on yourself do not take
place, but instead do damage as 'zap self' above.</p>

<h3><a id="confuse" name="confuse">confuse monster</a>
(enchantment, NODIR)</h3>

<p><strong>unskilled or basic</strong>
<br />
 Same effect as an uncursed scroll of confuse monster.
<br />
 If polymorphed into non-@, you are confused for 1 to 100
turns.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel confused."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, you will confuse the next (one more) monster you
hit.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Your &lt;hands&gt; begin to glow red." (unblind)
<br />
 "Your &lt;hands&gt; begin to glow red even more." (unblind, more)
<br />
 "Your &lt;hands&gt; tingle." (blind)
<br />
 "Your &lt;hands&gt; tingle even more." (blind, more)</p>

hit. (Once this number reaches 40, each blessed scroll will only
allow confusion of one additional monster.)</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Your &lt;hands&gt; glow a brilliant red." (unblind)
<br />
 "Your &lt;hands&gt; glow an even more brilliant red." (unblind,
more)

<br />
"&lt;Monster&gt; looks much better." (non-mimic in sight)</p>
</blockquote>

 If object is made of stone or mineral material (not gemstone), it

ring (ring) or huge chunk of meat (boulder). Converting Sokoban
boulders to flesh incurs a -1 luck penalty.</p>

<p>Statues and figurines may be animated. The animation fails if
the space is already occupied by another monster or the monster is
genocided (leaving a corpse, or an unchanged object if the monster
does not leave corpses), or if the monster is unique (leaving the
object unchanged) unless the statue was created by actually stoning
that unique monster.</p>
