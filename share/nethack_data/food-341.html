nutrition. Japanese names of items are listed in parentheses (). <a
id="cost" name="cost"></a>The COST field denotes the base price of
each item. <a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>WGT specifies the weight (100
zorkmids weighs 1).</p>

<p><a id="prob" name="prob"></a>Food comprises 20% of all
randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 15% in containers,
22% on the Rogue level, and 16% in hell. PROB is the relative
probability of each subtype. Eggs not laid by you have a roughly
1/3 probability of hatching. Tins are 1/6 spinach and are 5%
blessed, 90% uncursed, and 5% cursed. All other comestibles will be
generated uncursed.</p>

<p><a id="nutr" name="nutr"></a>The nutrition of each item is
listed under NUTR. The cost of all items are based on the nutrition
by the formula COST = (NUTR / 20) +5, with fractions rounded off.
Note that several previously archived spoilers did not correctly
round their costs. <a id="nw" name="nw"></a>The ratio of nutrition

if it is the case, then you lose one more point of nutrition that
turn. Rings and amulets cause additional hunger as shown; the only
exception is a ring that can be charged but is at +0. A ring of
slow digestion prevents base ordinary food consumption, but still
causes ring hunger. You can therefore consume a maximum of 64
nutrition in 20 turns (if all of these conditions were met).</p>

<p>There is a further reduction of the above chances for undead
creatures that die on a graveyard level: by 1/9 if it was killed by
you or by 1/3 if it was not killed by you (e.g., by a trap or
another monster). This means that wraiths have a better chance of
leaving a corpse if you lead them to a stairway and let them follow
you to a non-graveyard level, a technique called "wraith luring".
For this purpose, the Castle and all levels of the Priest Quest are
considered graveyard levels, as is any level on which undead have
been summoned by the cursed Book of the Dead or Bell of
Opening.</p>

<p>The nutrition, weight, and time needed to eat corpses is
determined by the type of monster. The blessed/cursed status of
corpses adjusts how fast they become tainted; corpses on an ice
surface age half as fast, corpses do not age while in iceboxes, and
lizard and lichen corpses never become tainted (though they do
become too old for sacrifice). Vampires, mummies and zombies leave
corpses that are already considered old. Tainted corpses do not
provide either nutrition or intrinsics.</p>

<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)</p>

<p>You can acquire useful intrinsics by eating certain corpses or
tins. The blessed/cursed status does <strong>not</strong> change
the likelihood of getting an intrinsic. If the monster has more
than one conferrable intrinsic, one is randomly picked, with equal
probability among all possible. The CHANCE that the picked
intrinsic is conferred varies among the different intrinsics; some
are based on the level of the monster (LEV). If you get the
intrinsic, you will get a MESSAGE (the second one if you are
hallucinating).</p>

<h2><a id="tins" name="tins"></a>Tins</h2>

<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)</p>

<p>You get up to 50 moves to open a tin; otherwise, you give up. If
you are wielding a tin opener, it takes one turn; any dagger or
crysknife, 3 turns; or a pick-axe or axe, 6 turns. Failing this, if
you have greasy fingers the tin will be dropped (if carried),
otherwise it will take 10+d(500/(DEX+STR)) turns to open (18/xx
strengths being mapped to the range 19-21). Blessed tins "open like
magic" in one turn. Cursed tins have a 1/8 chance of exploding and
will always contain rotten food, so they won't give any nutrition
but will make you even more hungry.</p>

<p>Tins made by you with a tinning kit are always homemade if not
cursed. All other tins are one of these fifteen possibilities:
pureed (500), deep fried (60), homemade (50), pickled (40), soup
(20), stir fried (80), candied (100), boiled (50), dried (55),
szechuan (70), french fried (40), sauteed (95), broiled (80),
smoked (50), or rotten (-50). The number in the parentheses is the
nutrition value of each. You cannot tell in advance what type a
given tin is.</p>

<p>When you eat deep fried or french fried food, you get slippery
fingers for up to 15 rounds, making you drop your wielded weapon.
You can shorten the time by (a)pplying a towel. Don't forget to
pick your weapon up again.</p>

<p>You can obtain intrinsics from eating tins, with the same chance
that you would have from eating the monster's corpse. Note that the
chance of getting an intrinsic does not change if the tin is
blessed or cursed.</p>

<p>One of the most useful tins is the tin of spinach. If the tin is
cursed, you lose strength equivalent to eating a giant corpse.
Otherwise, eating the spinach "makes you feel like Popeye" (or
Swee'pea while hallucinating) and gives you more strength
equivalent to a giant corpse. Tins of spinach have a nutrition of
600.</p>

<h2><a id="other" name="other"></a>Other food</h2>

<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)</p>

<p>Eating a spring of wolfsbane cures lycanthropy.</p>

<p>A carrot cures blindness. Ever seen a rabbit with glasses? (It
won't help with being creamed or envenomed, though.)</p>

<p>Eating a fortune cookie gives you a rumor. You can also just
(r)ead it without eating the cookie. The rumour is from the true
file if the cookie is blessed, the false file if cursed, or either
if uncursed.</p>

<p>Eating a lump of royal jelly increases (decreases if cursed)
your strength by one. If the jelly was cursed, you lose up to 20
hit points, otherwise you gain up to 20 HP and your wounded legs
heal. If your actual HP would become higher than your maximum HP,
there is a 1/17 chance of increasing your maximum HP by one.</p>

<p>Eating a cockatrice egg is a real bad idea if you're not
polymorphed into something that resists stoning. However, they are
very useful when thrown at monsters.</p>

<p>Eating green slime is also an extremely bad idea unless you're
polymorphed into something fiery or a slime yourself (or have
unchanging).</p>

<p>Eating a eucalyptus leaf cures sickness or vomiting. They can
also be a)pplied to give the effect of a tin whistle (cursed or
uncursed) or a magic whistle (blessed; this has a 1/49 chance of
unblessing the leaf).</p>

<p>Eating tripe may make you vomit (50% chance) unless you are a
Caveman or an orc, or polymorphed into a carnivorous
non-humanoid.</p>

<p>In addition to eating them, cream pies may be thrown to blind
their target, or you can a)pply one directly to blind yourself.</p>

<h2><a id="objects" name="objects"></a>Eating objects</h2>

<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)</p>

<p>There are some conditions before you can eat an object. If you
are polymorphed into a metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or
xorn), you may eat objects made of metal.</p>

<p>If you are polymorphed into a gelatinous cube, the object is
organic, and the object doesn't contain other objects, you may eat
it. This is different for real gelatinous cubes, which can eat a
container and hold the non-organic contents of that container
engulfed. So when such a beasty eats your chest with all the
artifacts, you may find them on its corpse.</p>

<p>You can never eat Unique Items such as the Amulet or the
invocation artifacts.</p>

<p>Eating something that isn't actually food always takes only one
move. The code addresses this issue by stating, "[We don't want] to
deal with partly eaten plate mails, players who polymorph back to
human in the middle of their metallic meal, etc...."</p>

<p>Eating rings has a 1/3 chance of conferring the intrinsic of the
ring. Eating amulets has a 1/5 chance of having an effect. Not all
intrinsics can be acquired this way. See the spoilers "<a
href="amul-341.html">amul-341.html</a>" and "<a
href="ring-341.html">ring-341.html</a>".</p>

<p>When you eat a leash with a monster on the other side, this
monster gets unleashed.</p>

<p>If you eat the iron ball or the chain while you are punished,
the punishment is gone. If you eat the chain, the ball is still
available to use as a weapon or to throw.</p>

<p>When you try to eat something rustproof while being polymorphed
into a rust monster, you spit it out non-rustproof and get stunned
a few rounds.</p>

<p>Eating a poisoned weapon has the same effect as eating poisonous
corpses. You get poisoned if you're not resistant.</p>

<p>Eating a non-cursed trident exercises wisdom. (This is
apparently a US-centric pun having something to do with a brand of
chewing gum.) "That was pure chewing satisfaction!"</p>

<p>Eating a non-cursed flint stone exercises constitution.
"Yabba-dabba delicious!" (Note however that there are no monsters
capable of eating flint stones in the present version.)</p>
