<h2><a id="smoky" name="smoky"></a>Smoky and milky potions</h2>

<p>Potions with the appearance "smoky" may release a djinni and
lead to a wish. Each time you or another monster quaff a smoky
potion, there is a chance of creating a djinni, depending on the
number of djinn that have already been created in the game:</p>

<table summary="Probability of djinn from smoky potions" border="1"
cellpadding="7">
<tr align="center">
<td align="left">DJINN:</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>n</td>
<td>&gt;=120</td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
<td align="left">PROB:</td>
<td>1/13</td>
<td>1/15</td>
<td>1/17</td>
<td>1/19</td>
<td>1/21</td>
<td>1/23</td>
<td>1/(13+2*n)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When the djinni appears, the potion is used up and one of five
outcomes can occur. The relative chance of these outcomes depends
on whether the smoky potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed:</p>

<td align="left">Remains as a pet.

<tr align="center" valign="top">

<td align="left">Remains as a peaceful monster.
<br />

<td>20%</td>
<td>80%</td>
<td align="left">Remains as a hostile monster.
<br />
 "You disturbed me, fool!"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If the potion had been quaffed by a monster, you will only get a
peaceful or vanishing djinni. NOTE: There is no way to get a wish
from the djinni other than the first outcome above.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, potions with the appearance "milky" may
summon a ghost. Each time you or another monster quaff a milky
potion, there is a chance of creating a ghost, depending on the
number of ghosts that have already been created in the game:</p>

<table summary="Probability of ghosts from milky potions"
border="1" cellpadding="7">
<tr align="center">
<td align="left">GHOSTS:</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>n</td>
<td>&gt;=120</td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
<td align="left">PROB:</td>
<td>1/13</td>
<td>1/15</td>
<td>1/17</td>
<td>1/19</td>
<td>1/21</td>
<td>1/23</td>
<td>1/(13+2*n)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When the ghost appears, the potion is used up. If the potion was
quaffed by a monster, that monster is paralyzed for 3 turns.
Otherwise, if you are unblind, you are paralyzed for 3 turns.</p>

<p>There is a limit of 120 djinn (or ghosts) per game. Beyond this
limit, they are extinct and no more can be created.</p>

<h2><a id="cancel" name="cancel"></a>Cancelling and diluting
potions</h2>

<p>There are several ways to turn potions into water. If potions of
sickness, see invisible, or fruit juice are hit by a wand or spell
of cancellation, they become uncursed potions of fruit juice, with
the same amount of dilution as before the cancellation. Potions of
oil and booze become uncursed but otherwise remain the same. Other
potions will become uncursed potions of water.</p>

<p>You can also change potions of blindness, confusion, or
hallucination into uncursed water -- or potions of sickness into
fruit juice -- by #dipping a unicorn horn into these potions. Note
that if you had quaffed these potions, you would have suffered bad
effects that could have been cured by the unicorn horn in any case.
You can also #dip an amethyst stone into booze to convert it into
fruit juice ("a-methyst" means not intoxicated.) In either of these
cases, only one potion will be converted, regardless of the number
of potions in the inventory slot.</p>

<p>Finally, you can turn any potion except acid into water by
#dipping it into an uncursed potion of water or fountain (the
latter may cause bad effects as well). If you are over a pool or
moat but not levitating, you can also #dip into that water.
Furthermore, if you swim under water or fall into water, your
potions have a chance of getting wet. If you #dip a potion of acid
or it gets wet it does 1 to 10 points of damage.</p>

<p>Getting potions wet happens in two stages. After one dipping,
the potions will become diluted, but will have their same blessed
state. Diluted potions have exactly their same effects as undiluted
potions (with minor exceptions for booze and fruit juice). Getting
diluted potions wet again then converts them into uncursed water.
Note that water cannot be diluted.</p>

<h2><a id="holy" name="holy"></a>Holy water</h2>

<p>(Adapted from the spoiler "water", by Maurice Vliege.)</p>

<p>Once you have potions of water, you can convert them to holy
water at an altar with your same alignment. Drop any unholy water
or uncursed water that you wish to convert onto the altar, and
#pray. If your god was pleased with you, they will all be converted
to holy water.</p>

<p>To make unholy water, you must find an altar of a different
alignment than your own that is not in Gehennom. Drop any holy
water or uncursed water that you wish to convert onto the altar,
and #pray. All of the potions will be converted to unholy water. It
does not matter if your god was pleased before, but your god will
be upset after the prayer.</p>

<p>Holy and unholy water may also be found randomly, may appear in
bones piles from other characters, and can be wished for. Holy
water may be part of your initial inventory (priests start with
four). A more obscure way to acquire holy or unholy water is to
wield some uncursed potions of water, take off all other worn
items, and read a non-cursed scroll of remove curse while confused.
You have a 25% chance of creating holy water and 25% chance of
creating unholy water this way, and it doesn't need any altars!
Blessed scrolls of remove curse will have the same effect on each
item in your inventory individually (try splitting up the water
into different slots by #naming); be careful of other items in
inventory becoming cursed.</p>

<p>Once you have holy water, you can uncurse any cursed item or
bless any uncursed items by the dipping the item into a potion of
holy water. Similarly, dipping a blessed item into unholy water
makes it uncursed, and dipping an uncursed item into unholy water
makes it cursed. In all cases, one of the potions of (un)holy water
is used in the process. By dipping several uncursed potions of
water into a potion of (un)holy water, you can continue to make
more (un)holy water indefinitely (as long as you have uncursed
water).</p>

<p>Dipping an item in holy or unholy water does NOT rust, blank,
dilute, or otherwise damage it.</p>

<h2><a id="alchemy" name="alchemy"></a>Dipping and mixing
potions</h2>

<p>(Adapted from a posting by Paul Brinkley.)</p>

<p>The effects of #dipping various objects into potions is
summarized in the table below. You are first prompted for the item
to be DIPPED, and then the potion to dip it INTO. One of the
potions dipped into will be used up, unless there was no effect or
the potions were cancelled by the dipping (unicorn horn or
amethyst). Except where shown, it doesn't matter if potions are
diluted before dipping.</p>

<p>You can mix two non-water potions (or groups of potions) of
different types by dipping one into the other; this procedure is
commonly referred to as "alchemy". There is a 10% chance of an
explosion (always if the DIPPED is cursed or acid) which makes you
breathe vapors of the DIPPED potion, abuses your strength, and
makes you lose one of each potion. Otherwise, the DIPPED potion(s)
may become a different type of potion, which will always be
uncursed and diluted, and you use up one of the INTO potions. The
possible mixtures are also described in the table below.</p>
