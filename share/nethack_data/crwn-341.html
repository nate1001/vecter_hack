<p>When you are in good standing with your god ("piously aligned")
and sufficiently lucky, when you pray a lot of nice things can
happen. One of these things is that you may be "crowned" by your
god.</p>

<p>If this happens, you are not only granted a title (visible with
enlightenment or at the end of the game), but some other effects
(most of them beneficial) happen as well. The title you will gain
is the following:</p>

<p>Lawful: Hand of Elbereth
<br />
Neutral: Envoy of Balance
<br />
Chaotic: Glory of Arioch</p>

<p>Then, you gain some useful intrinsics (if you didn't have them
already, of course):</p>

<ul>
<li>cold resistance</li>

<li>fire resistance</li>

<li>poison resistance</li>

<li>sleep resistance</li>

<li>shock resistance</li>

<li>see invisible</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, you may gain an item, depending on your class and
alignment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wizards will receive a (blessed) spellbook of finger of death
unless they are already carrying one, or are wielding Vorpal Blade
or Stormbringer.</li>

<li>Monks will receive a (blessed) spellbook of restore ability
unless they are already carrying one, or are wielding an
artifact.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these classes do not receive a spellbook, or for any other
class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lawful: If you are wielding (as primary, if two-weaponing) a
non-artifact long sword, it is changed into Excalibur if</li>

<li>that does not yet exist in your game.</li>

<li>Neutral: If Vorpal Blade does not yet exist in your game, it is
created at your feet.</li>

<li>Chaotic: If Stormbringer does not yet exist in your game, it is
created at your feet.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you received a weapon gift, it is blessed, unrusted and made
rustproof, and set to at least +1. If you received no gift (or you
received a spellbook gift of a spell that you already knew), your
currently-wielded (primary) weapon (or weapon-tool) receives the
same enhancements, and your skill in it is unrestricted. In all
cases, your skill in the appropriate alignment gift weapon is
unrestricted whether you got it or not: long sword for lawfuls and
neutrals, broad sword for chaotics.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a disadvantage to balance all this
generosity: after crowning, your average prayer time-out (the time
you have to wait between prayers) is greatly increased. So, if you
already have a decent weapon and the above intrinsics, being named
is a BAD thing. If you pray often enough, it WILL happen
eventually, though.</p>

<p>Basically, when your god crowns you, it's his way of telling
you: "I've given you quite enough by now... Now bugger off and
don't pester me..."</p>
