<p><a id="cost" name="cost"></a><a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>Scrolls
are listed above by increasing price, then alphabetically. The COST
field denotes the base price of each item. WGT specifies the weight
(100 zorkmids weighs 1).</p>

<p><a id="prob" name="prob"></a>Scrolls comprise 16% of all
randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 18% in containers,
22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell. PROB is the relative
probability of each subtype. Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed, 3/4
uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.</p>

<p>Scrolls of mail exist only if this ability was compiled into
your copy of the game, and if you have the "mail" option enabled.
When new email arrives (or every 1999+d(3000) turns if playing on
an Amiga or DOS platform), the "mail daemon" will deliver a scroll
of mail. All of these scrolls are considered uncursed, and they
cannot be changed into another object in any way.</p>

<p><a id="mrkr" name="mrkr"></a>MRKR specifies the value used to
determine the number of magic marker charges needed to write a
scroll of that type, or zero if it cannot be written. The actual
number of charges used will be a random amount from MRKR/2 to
MRKR-1; if your marker has fewer than MRKR/2 charges, you will be
unable to attempt to write the scroll.</p>

<p>Wizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and
all other classes have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally
improves with higher luck, to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards
and 32% for other classes. You can only write scrolls on blank
paper, which can be made by getting any scroll wet (except mail) or
cancelling any scroll (except mail). Failure to write the scroll
will cause the blank scroll to be used up. You can select non-blank
scrolls to write on, but this will abuse your wisdom and you will
be told, "That scroll is not blank!"</p>

<p><a id="appearance" name="appearance"></a>Some types of scrolls
have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified. The appearance of the
remaining scrolls are are randomized from the following
descriptions:</p>

<h2><a id="effects" name="effects"></a>Scroll messages and
effects</h2>

<p>(Adapted from the spoiler "scrolls", by Ian Burrell.)</p>

<p>In order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know
the APPEARANCE of the scroll. When a scroll is read, it will be
used up and disappear (except blank paper). The effects depend on
the blessing of the scroll. Non-cursed means either blessed or
uncursed. If you are confused while reading the scroll, "you
mispronounce the magic words" and may obtain a different effect.
Some scrolls have a different message for "beginners"; a character
is considered a beginner until accumulating 2000 score points (1000
for Wizards).</p>

<h3><a id="amnesia" name="amnesia"></a>amnesia</h3>

<p>All Sokoban maps are immune from the effects of amnesia.</p>

<p><strong>cursed or you are NOT confused</strong>
<br />
 You forget all of the current level.</p>

<p><strong>non-cursed and confused</strong>

 You forget 6/7 of the current level.</p>

<p>In addition, if <strong>uncursed or cursed</strong>
<br />
 You forget any number of spells.</p>

<p>In every case,
<br />
 You have a 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of all known level
maps and a separate 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of object
identities.
<br />
 You forget all traps on your current level, forget whether you are
punished, and abuse your wisdom.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">

 "Who was that Maud person anyway?" (otherwise, 50%)

50%)</p>

recharged: (x^3)/(7^3).</p>
