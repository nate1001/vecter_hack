<p><a id="cost" name="cost"></a><a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>Items
are listed here by inventory category. Venom is generated only by
spitting monsters and cannot be picked up. The COST field denotes
the base price of each item. WGT specifies the weight. <a id="prob"
name="prob"></a>If the item can be randomly generated, then PROB is
the relative probability of the item within that category. All of
these items are generated uncursed. <a id="sym" name="sym"></a>SYM
is the object symbol. <a id="damage" name="damage"></a>Damage to
small and large monsters is the DAMAGE field. An additional +d(x*4)
of damage is added to iron balls for each x times the ball has been
made heavier (cursed scrolls of punishment count double), up to a
total damage of 25. <a id="nutr" name="nutr"></a>If an object can
be eaten, its nutrition value is NUTR.</p>

<p>Iron balls start out at a weight and nutrition of 480; each time
you are further punished, any ball you are chained to has these
increased by 160 (320 in the case of a cursed scroll of
punishment).</p>

<h2><a id="statues" name="statues"></a>Finding spellbooks in
statues</h2>

<p>(Adapted in part from the spoiler "statues" by Bryan Butler and
Boudewijn Waijers.)</p>

<p>Randomly created statues may contain one random spellbook. The
chance of a spellbook in a statue depends upon the dungeon level on
which the statue was created (if you are visiting a level for the
first time while carrying the Amulet, then the depth of the Sanctum
will be used instead):</p>

</tr>
</table>

<p>Statues of tiny monsters never contain spellbooks.</p>

<p>Note that the Oracle is located somewhere between levels 5 and
9, so the average chance on that level that a statue contains a
spellbook is about (1/12 + 2*2/13 + 2*3/14) / 5 = (1790/2184) / 5 =
0.164. Since there are always eight centaur statues on that level,
the chance of finding no spellbook there is about 0.24. The chance
of finding just one is about 0.37. The chance of finding two is
about 0.26. Chances of finding more rapidly approach zero.</p>

<p>Note that the player monster statues (other than Perseus) on the
Medusa level will always be empty; the seven or eight monster
statues may contain the appropriate monster's starting inventory.
Perseus' statue has a 50% chance of containing a blessed +2
scimitar and a 50% chance of containing a sack. If the version of
the level is the one with the central island, there is also a 25%
chance of +0 levitation boots and 75% chance of a cursed +0 shield
of reflection; on the version with a titan, these two chances are
reversed.</p>

<p>Statues created by stoning a monster contain only the items in
the monster's inventory. You can break a statue with a pick axe,
dwarvish mattock, wand of striking, or spell of force bolt.
Breaking or animating historic statues (the centaur statues of
Delphi, the statue of Perseus, the gnome king statue in the Grotto
Town version of Minetown, or petrified unique monsters) carries a
-1 alignment penalty for Archeologists.</p>

<h2><a id="chains" name="chains"></a>What to do with iron
chains</h2>

<p>Iron chains are the least useful items in the game since they
perform no function as individual objects, have no value to sell to
shopkeepers, aren't heavy enough to be a decent weapon, and will
always polypile into another chain. Here are several somewhat
trivial uses for these objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Throw or kick them as missiles.</li>

<li>Food for rock moles (a pet or polyself).</li>

<li>Leave them in the path of hostile metallivores as a
distraction.</li>

<li>Polypile enough of them to make another iron golem. Turn it
into your pet or polymorph it into a monster worthy of
sacrificing.</li>

<li>Polypile enough of them to get another iron golem. Tame it and
watch it get killed by a rust monster. Get an amusing message.</li>

<li>Use them to mark the vibrating square.</li>

<li>Carry them in your main inventory to lower the chance that
something "good" will be cursed/stolen.</li>

<li>Leave a bones file that will annoy others (using ASCII): "Darn,
that's not an altar."</li>
</ul>
