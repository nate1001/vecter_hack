<h2><a id="chat" name="chat"></a>Chatting to priests</h2>

<p>Priests will only be willing to chat if they are still peaceful,
in their own aligned temple, and have freedom of action; trying to
talk to a priest otherwise will arouse his wrath.</p>

<p>If the priest is talkative, #chatting to him can have various
results:</p>

<p>If you have no visible money, the priest will not ask for a
donation; if additionally you are co-aligned with him, and your
alignment is non-negative, your wisdom is exercised, and he will
give you "two bits for an ale" (2 zorkmids; just one if that's all
he has, or if he has no money he will "preach the virtues of
poverty.)</p>

<p>Otherwise, you will be asked "for a contribution to the temple".
The outcome depends on how much you donate (in relation to your
experience level), and what proportion of your visible gold this
represents.</p>

<table summary="results of donating to priests" border="1"
cellpadding="7">
<tr valign="top">
<td>0 zorkmids</td>
<td>"Thou shalt regret thine action!" -1 to alignment if
co-aligned, otherwise no effect.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1 zorkmid to (200*XL)-1</td>
<td>If donation less than one-third of current visible gold,
"Cheapskate"; otherwise "I thank thee for thy contribution" and
exercise wisdom.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>200*XL to (400*XL)-1</td>
<td>"Thou art indeed a pious individual." If donation one-third of
current visible gold or less, no further effect. Otherwise, "I
bestow on thee a blessing" and gain clairvoyance for 500 to 999
(more) turns; additionally, if co-aligned and alignment -4 or
worse, +1 to alignment.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>400*XL to (600*XL)-1</td>
<td>A possibility of receiving protection, as detailed <a
href="#protection">below</a>; if protection not granted, same
effects as next case.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>600*XL or greater</td>
<td>"Thy selfless generosity is deeply appreciated." If co-aligned
and donation greater than one-third of current visible gold, +2 to
alignment (or, if alignment negative and more than 5000 turns since
this effect last occurred, alignment instead restored to 0);
otherwise, no effect.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a id="protection" name="protection"></a>Protection from
priests</h2>

<p>If you donate between 400 times your experience level in gold
and 1 less than 600 times your experience level to any temple
priest (regardless of alignment), you may receive divine protection
as a result, which manifests as an improvement in your armour
class. This depends on your intrinsic (naked, ringless and
spell-less) AC as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7"
summary="Reduction in AC from donating">
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>AC reduced by 2 to 4.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2 to 9</td>
<td>AC reduced by 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-9 to 1</td>
<td>1/(10-(AC)) chance of AC being reduced by 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-10 or less</td>
<td>No reduction in AC.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So, intrinsic AC can (with enough money) be easily reduced to 1;
reductions below this point immediately become increasingly
unlikely; and -10 is a hard limit for AC improvement by this
method. (Other means of gaining intrinsic protection, such as
divine gift from prayer or eating rings of protection, will still
be available.)</p>

<p>If AC is reduced by donation, "Thy devotion has been rewarded";
otherwise, "Thy selfless generosity is deeply appreciated", and
alignment may be improved as detailed above.</p>
