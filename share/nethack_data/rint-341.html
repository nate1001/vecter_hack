<p>This spoiler covers all intrinsics that may be granted by
wearing rings, other than the dragon resistances already dealt with
in <a href="drgn-341.html">drgn-341.html</a>: how to acquire them
(in addition to their ring source), how to lose them, and what
effects they have. Note that, as a general rule, any intrinsics
acquired solely by experience level can be lost by being drained
below that level.</p>
