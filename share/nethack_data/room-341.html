<p>This spoiler only considers the special rooms that can be
generated randomly in the main Dungeons of Doom. Certain special
levels have their own predefined special rooms (shops in Minetown
and the Tourist Quest, zoos in Sokoban and the Wizard's Tower, and
many others).</p>

<h2><a id="special" name="special"></a>Special rooms</h2>

<p>The usual name describing the room is given first, then in
brackets the chance of creation, the range of Dungeon Levels within
the Dungeons of Doom in which the room is eligible to be created,
and any other constraints on generation. Following this is a list
of messages (level sounds) which may be given when on a level which
has that room, and messages given when entering the room (as
opposed to greetings from its occupant, if any).</p>

<p>The chances listed are cumulative; once one type of special room
has been created, no others are eligible to be created, and they
are considered in order. No special rooms from this list will be
created on the Oracle, Big Room, Rogue, Medusa or Castle
levels.</p>

for what that stock may consist of.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a id="shops" name="shops"></a>Shops</h2>

<p>Shops have a base 3/DL chance of being created between level 2
and Medusa, provided there is a suitable room to put them in (no
stairs, only one door), and provided that there are enough rooms on
the level to start with (minimum 3, 4 for a branch level). Note
that this means that there will always be a shop on each of levels
2 and 3 if the conditions are right (which in practice turns out to
only be the case about 45% of the time).</p>

<p>There are eleven types of shop; of these, one (lighting) can
only appear in Minetown. Their probabilities of random creation and
their stock distribution are:</p>

</table>

<p>PROB is the percentage chance of a random shop being of this
type. Shops with probabilities marked * may not be larger than 20
squares; if they would otherwise be (about half the time), they are
converted into general stores instead.</p>
