is magic or not.</p>

<h2><a id="dip" name="dip"></a>Dipping items in fountains</h2>

<p>From <a href="art1-341.html">art1-341.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at
least experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in
your game, then there is a 1/6 chance of something special
happening to your long sword. If you are lawful, the long sword is
converted into the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof
Excalibur and you exercise your wisdom. If you are neutral or
chaotic, your long sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may
lose an enchantment, and you abuse your wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fountain then disappears; this will anger the Minetown Watch
whether you've been warned or not, if that's where you happen to
be.</p>

<p>In any other case, the dipping is handled normally. First, the
object gets wet and does the appropriate things (scrolls and
spellbooks blank, potions dilute, metal things rust, lit objects go
out, grease washes off). Then special effects can happen:</p>
