<h2><a id="effects" name="effects"></a>Potion messages and
effects</h2>

<p>(Adapted from the WCST spoiler "spoil803".)</p>

<p>What happens when you (q)uaff a potion usually depends on
whether the potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed. If a monster
can quaff a potion, the effects upon the monster are documented
below; all other potions won't be quaffed by monsters.</p>

<p>When a potion hits a monster, the monster will be awoken and has
an 80% chance of losing one hit point (but not killed), and then
suffers the effects described below. If you didn't see the monster
get hit, you will be told, "Crash!". Monsters are not angered by
potions of (extra|full) healing, (gain|restore) ability, speed,
invisibility, water thrown at gremlins, or unholy water thrown at
werecreatures, demons or undead; other potions will cause peaceful
monsters to become hostile if you were the thrower.</p>

<p>If a potion hits you, you lose 1 to 2 hit points and get the
effects of breathing vapors described below unless the potion has a
specific effect for hitting you. You may also breathe vapors if you
are near a potion when it breaks (e.g., it hit a monster, was hit
by a wand of striking, or was kicked). If you are polymorphed into
an unbreathing monster, the vapours will get into your eyes for the
same effect. If you are polymorphed into a monster that neither
breaths nor has eyes, vapours will have no effect.</p>

<h3><a id="acid" name="acid"></a>acid</h3>

<br />

quaffing the potion. Some monsters may resist.
