<p>While NetHack is a single-player game, a certain amount of
interaction between games (and, on a multi-user system, between
players) is provided by bones files; levels on which a previous
character has died being loaded into a new game for a new character
to encounter, complete with the ghost of the former adventurer and
their belongings (or indeed ghosts, since bones levels can be
themselves left as bones should you die there).</p>

<p>On any given system, only one bones file can be waiting at any
time for each distinct level. For this purpose, special levels are
considered distinct from normal ones; for example, an Oracle level
at DL 6 can leave bones despite the prior presence of a stored
bones file for a regular Dungeons level at that depth, and can be
loaded in at a different depth if that's where the Oracle happens
to be located in the new game.</p>

<h2><a id="leaving" name="leaving">Leaving bones files</a></h2>

<p>Some levels are ineligible to be saved as bones under any
circumstances, and should you die on these levels you will never
leave a bones file:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dungeons of Doom levels 1-3*</li>

<li>Medusa's Island</li>

<li>The Castle</li>

<li>Gnomish Mines level 1 (maybe)**</li>

<li>Mines' End</li>

<li>Sokoban (all levels)</li>

<li>Quest home and goal levels</li>

<li>Fort Ludios</li>

<li>Wizard's Tower top and bottom levels</li>

<li>Fake Wizard's Tower with portal</li>

<li>Vibrating Square level</li>

<li>Moloch's Sanctum</li>

<li>Vlad's Tower top and bottom levels</li>

<li>Endgame (all levels)</li>

<li>Any level with a dungeon branch</li>
</ul>

<p>* This is a consequence of the formula given below
<br />
** If at DL3, as a consequence of the formula given below</p>

<p>This means that the following levels are eligible to leave bones
and have bones files loaded for them (provided they don't contain
the entrance to another dungeon branch):</p>

<ul>
<li>Dungeons of Doom (normal) DL 4+</li>

<li>Oracle</li>

<li>Big Room</li>

<li>Rogue Level</li>

<li>Gnomish Mines (normal) DL 4+*</li>

<li>Minetown</li>

<li>Quest locate and filler levels</li>

<li>Gehennom (normal)</li>

<li>Valley of the Dead</li>

<li>Asmodeus' Lair</li>

<li>Juiblex' Swamp</li>

<li>Baalzebub's Lair</li>

<li>Orcus-town</li>

<li>Wizard's Tower middle level</li>

<li>Fake Wizard's Tower without portal</li>

<li>Vlad's Tower middle level</li>
</ul>

<p>* Stored bones for Mines level 1 may be loaded at DL3, but not
left at that depth.</p>

<p>If you die on a level that is eligible to leave bones, the
chance of your doing so is dependent on the depth of that level:
1-(1/(1+(DL/4))) (note that this, combined with NetHack's use of
integer arithmetic, means that no level above DL 4 will ever leave
bones). The only other factor is that you will not leave bones if
you were swallowed or engulfed when you died; "Nothing else. Not
how you died, not what level you were, not what's in your
inventory, not whether it was loaded as bones, not any intrinsics
or god status or nearby monster." (from a Usenet article).</p>

<p>When bones are saved, you and your possessions are saved along
with them, along with the level layout, objects, and monsters.
There are, however, certain modifications made:</p>

<p>You leave a corpse, under most circumstances. If you were
polymorphed and unchanging, it will be that of your monster form
(if that can leave corpses); otherwise, it will be that of your
race. No corpse will be left if you are disintegrated, burned to
death, die while unchanging and polymorphed into a monster that
does not leave corpses, or arise from the dead as a different
monster as detailed below. If you are stoned, you will instead
leave a statue containing your possessions.</p>

<p>If you leave a corpse, a grave is created (with the tombstone
bearing your character's name and manner of death) if the location
is one where a grave can occur (a non-trapped "floor of a room"
square of open space).</p>

<p>You become a ghost, under most circumstances. If you died by
sliming, you instead arise from the dead as a green slime. If you
were killed by any W, you arise from the dead as a wraith; by any
M, as a mummy of your race; by any V and you are human, as a
vampire; by a ghoul, as a ghoul. In each case, the monster you
arise as will be carrying your possessions. If you are stoned, no
ghost is created.</p>

<p>Items that were in your character's main inventory each have an
80% chance of becoming cursed, if they weren't already. Items that
were inside containers are unaffected, whether the container is
cursed or not.</p>

<p>Some monsters will never be saved in bones: the Wizard of
Yendor, your Quest Nemesis and Leader, Vlad the Impaler, and
Medusa.</p>

<h2><a id="loading" name="loading">Loading bones files</a></h2>

<p>When you first arrive at a level for which bones are eligible to
be loaded and for which a stored bones file exists on the system,
there is a flat 1/3 chance that that file will be loaded.</p>

<p>The monsters on the level will have their peaceful status
adjusted to suit the character arriving there (for example, just
because the dwarfs and gnomes on a Mines level were peaceful
towards the dwarvish character that died there, doesn't mean
they'll be peaceful towards your orc who's found those bones). In
particular, this means that the previous character's pets will
often be found hostile.</p>

<p>Artifacts in the bones file that exist or have existed in the
new game will be converted to an ordinary non-artifact object of
their type, as will the Quest Artifact for the new character's
role. The four Unique Items will become normal items: the Amulet of
Yendor a cursed cheap plastic imitation, the Bell of Opening a
cursed bell, the Book of the Dead a cursed blank spellbook, and the
Candelabrum of Invocation a number of partly-used wax candles
corresponding to the number of candles (of any type) as had been in
the Candelabrum (at least one). Tins of unique monsters will become
empty.</p>

<h2><a id="compat" name="compat">Bones compatibility</a></h2>

<p>Generally, bones files created by different versions of NetHack,
or builds on different platforms or with different compile options,
will not be compatible with each other. Bones created by a
sufficiently similar build of the same version on a sufficiently
similar platform may be compatible enough to be loaded; you can
move them into place manually, or use a bones exchange service such
as Hearse (<a
