<h1>Miscellaneous intrinsics in NetHack 3.4</h1>

<p>This covers all the intrinsics that are neither dragon
resistances (see <a href="drgn-341.html">drgn-341.html</a>) or
conferred by wearing rings (see <a
href="rint-341.html">rint-341.html</a>). It does not cover statuses
(confusion, hallucination, etc); the dividing line is sometimes
blurry, but as a general rule of thumb if it appears on the status
line it's a status, not an intrinsic. Note that, as a general rule,
any intrinsics acquired solely by experience level can be lost by
being drained below that level.</p>
