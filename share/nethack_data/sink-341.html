<h2><a id="other" name="other">Other sink effects</a></h2>

<p>Sinks, as the name suggests, will cause anything in the air
above them to fall to the floor: thrown weapons, or you when
levitating. Dropping rings onto a sink will usually cause them to
be lost down it, with a message that may enable you to identify the
ring; see <a href="ring-341.html">ring-341.html</a> for a list of
these effects.</p>
