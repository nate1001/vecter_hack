<p>Gems and stones are listed above by category, then by decreasing
price. <a id="cost" name="cost"></a><a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>The
COST field denotes the base price of each item. WGT specifies the
weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).</p>

<p><a id="prob" name="prob"></a>Gems comprise 8% of all
randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 18% in containers, 0%
on the Rogue level, and 10% in hell. PROB is the relative
probability of each subtype, except for those marked with an
asterisk (valuable gems); the figures so marked instead represent
the first level on which the gems can occur (this limitation only
applying to the main dungeon, and these restrictions are only
reviewed when creating a new level). Permissible valuable gems have
roughly equal probabilities of being generated among themselves,
always set such that the total for the category as a whole is
171.</p>

<p>Loadstones are always generated cursed (except potentially in
containers), all others are uncursed. Rocks appear in piles of 6 to
11. Valuable gems, worthless gems, touchstones, and flint stones
have a 1/6 chance of appearing in a pile of 2.</p>

<p><a id="engr" name="engr"></a><a id="color" name="color"></a>The
ENGR field denotes how the gem appears when you attempt to engrave
with it (see below). COLORS specifies the possible appearance of
the gem. If more than one color is possible, then one will be
randomly chosen for the appearance.</p>

<h2><a id="stones" name="stones"></a>Identifying stones</h2>

<p>There are five different types of non-gem stones, and four of
them are indistinguishably gray.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>rock</strong></dt>

<dd>Rocks are immediately identified on examination, and pose
little difficulty or challenge to the adventurer. They make a cheap
and usually plentiful source of ammunition, should you lack or wish
to conserve other ranged attacks. ("Good ol' rock. Nothing beats
that." -- Bart Simpson)</dd>

<dt><strong>touchstone</strong></dt>

<dd>Touchstones are most readily distinguished by their effect when
rubbed with something hard, such as an iron weapon; they will make
a "scritch, scritch" sound. Their primary use is rubbing them with
other gems and stones (and, once identified, this is all they _can_
be used for); if blessed (or also if uncursed, for Archeologists
and gnomes), the object rubbed with will be identified. The
complete table of results that distinguish them is as follows: 
<table cellpadding="7" border="1" summary="touchstone results">
<tr align="right">
<th>GRAY STONE</th>
<th>GEM</th>
<th>GLASS</th>
<th>HARD</th>
<th>RING</th>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>good touchstone</td>
<td>ID</td>
<td>ID</td>
<td>scritch</td>
<td>streak</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>bad touchstone</td>
<td>streak</td>
<td>scratch</td>
<td>scritch</td>
<td>streak</td>
</tr>

<tr align="right">
<td>other gray stone</td>
<td>cscratch</td>
<td>cscratch</td>
<td>scratch</td>
<td>cscratch</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>where "streak" denotes coloured streaks, "scratch" uncoloured
scratch marks, "cscratch" coloured scratch marks, and "scritch" the
sound "scritch scritch".</p>

<p>Other types of object may produce coloured streaks or scratches,
but will not provide any further useful information.</p>

<p>Note that being rubbed on a cursed touchstone may shatter gems
or rocks (but not other gray stones).</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong>luckstone</strong></dt>

<dd>Luckstones can be identified by their effect (see "Luck" below)
with the help of enlightenment, by their valuation by shopkeepers,
or by the presence of the guaranteed luckstone at the top of a gems
cache in the Gnome King's Wine Cellar version of the bottom level
of the Gnomish Mines. (Or, indeed, by the Heart of Ahriman being
one).</dd>

<dt><strong>loadstone</strong></dt>

<dd>As noted above, loadstones are almost always generated cursed;
furthermore, they autocurse on being dropped or otherwise leaving
the main inventory, and a cursed loadstone cannot be let go of. It
is therefore best to identify them while they lie on the ground;
kicking them will usually elicit a "Thump!" rather than movement
across the floor, but being extremely strong (at least 22 strength;
18/** is not sufficient) while wearing kicking boots or being a
Samurai or Monk may allow some movement (watch how far it
goes).</dd>

<dt><strong>flint stone</strong></dt>

<dd>These exist primarily to make it hard to identify touchstones,
loadstones and luckstones, and are best identified by elimination
of the other three. They have few special properties, but do
inflict somewhat more damage than other stones or gems when used as
sling ammunition.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a id="id" name="id"></a>Identifying gems</h2>

<p>(Quoted in part from the spoiler "gems" by Bryan Butler.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I shall, with cultured taste,
<br />
 Distinguish gems from paste..."
<br />
 -- Reginald Bunthorne, in Gilbert and Sullivan's "Patience"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are now nine methods to identify gems: engraving, throwing
at unicorns, killing glass golems, spell of stone to flesh,
collecting a large number, scrolls or spells of identify, a
touchstone, dipping an amethyst in potions of booze, and finding
pre-placed gems.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Engraving with gems</strong> 
<p>If a gem is listed as "hard" above, then you will see the
following message when you attempt to (E)ngrave with the gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You engrave in the &lt;floor&gt; with the &lt;gem&gt;."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where &lt;gem&gt; is the appearance of the gem. All hard gems
are valuable, although some colors may have more than one possible
identity.</p>

<p>If the gem is "soft," you will see this message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You write in the dust with the &lt;gem&gt;."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Soft gems may be valuable or worthless, so you will need an
additional method to identify these gems.</p>

<p>In either case, you can abort the engraving process by pressing
Escape. If you choose to write a message, it will take one turn per
character to engrave. Not all types of floor can be engraved upon.
You may choose to #name a gem once you know its hardness (e.g.,
"soft blue").</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Throwing gems at unicorns</strong> 
<p>Throwing a gem to a non-tame unicorn can change your luck in one
of several ways, depending on whether the gem is worthless or
valuable, whether you are the same alignment as the unicorn (white
= lawful, gray = neutral, and black = chaotic), and whether the gem
type is already identified or named.</p>

<table summary="Throwing Gems to Unicorns" border="1"

<tr>

<p>In most cases, the message sequence is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The &lt;unicorn&gt; neighs! The &lt;unicorn&gt; catches the
&lt;gem&gt;."
<br />
 "The &lt;unicorn&gt; &lt;ADVERB&gt; accepts your gift."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where the color of the unicorn and the color of the gem are
appropriate for the situation. &lt;ADVERB&gt; comes from the table
above, except where the column has a *, in which case there is a
different message sequence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The &lt;unicorn&gt; neighs!"
<br />
 "The &lt;unicorn&gt; catches the &lt;glass&gt;."
<br />
 "The &lt;unicorn&gt; is not interested in your junk."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>after which the unicorn will promptly drop the "gem".</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Killing glass golems</strong> 
<p>When a glass golem is destroyed, it leaves behind 2 to 8
worthless pieces of glass (each of which can be any of the
colours), and never gems.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Spell of stone to flesh</strong> 
<p>The spell of stone to flesh will turn gemstones into meatballs,
but leave worthless pieces of glass intact; #name a gem 'valuable'
or similar before zapping the spell at it (and rename it afterwards
should it be proven untrue), since it won't be around to #name
after.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Collecting a large number of gems</strong> 
<p>If you wait long enough, you'll accumulate a large number of
gems. Since the probabilities of getting worthless pieces of glass
are so much higher than getting true gems, you'll acquire them much
faster than other gems. So, if you just wait long enough, and look
at all of the gems of a certain color that you have, more often
than not the gem of which you have the most is the worthless piece
of glass. This is a bit risky, and usually takes much more time
than other methods.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Scrolls and spells of identify</strong> 
<p>You can always use a scroll or spell of identify to determine
whether a gem is valuable. You will then recognize all gems of that
same type, although you can lose this knowledge from a scroll of
amnesia or (master) mind flayer attack. Shopkeepers will buy
identified gems based on their full price; this is a good way to
get money.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Rubbing on a touchstone</strong> 
<p>Being rubbed on a blessed touchstone (or also uncursed for
Archeologists, who start with one, and gnomes) will immediately
identify any gem, as detailed under "touchstones" above.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Dipping amethysts into potions of booze</strong> 
<p>When you dip an amethyst into a potion(s) of booze, the potion
will turn into fruit juice ("a-methyst" means not intoxicated). You
can use this very special case to identify this type of soft violet
gems.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Pre-placed gems</strong> 
<p>Certain levels are guaranteed to be generated with diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, and amethysts in well-defined positions. Two
versions of the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines (the Wine Cellar
version and Mimic of the Mines version) contain concealed chambers
with these four types of gems and a guaranteed luckstone, together
with assorted other * to confuse identification; the third
version's are randomly scattered across the level. The four corner
rooms of Fort Ludios (if it is reachable in your game) each contain
one of these four types of valuable gems. Other levels may also be
generated with piles of gems, but their type is not guaranteed, so
these levels are not helpful in determining the identity of
gems.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="luck" name="luck"></a>Luck</h2>

<p>Luck is included here because of luckstones.</p>

<p>Your luck affects many aspects of the game (too many to mention
here), and is actually the sum of two components. Base luck changes
with events in the game, and may slowly return to a "baseline"
level. Bonus luck, on the other hand, is determined by what kind of
luckstone (and certain artifacts) you are carrying. Only a rough
idea of your luck is given in the enlightenment list; the meaning
of the messages is as follows:</p>

<table summary="Luck messages and enlightenment" border="1"
cellpadding="7">
<tr>
<th>TOTAL LUCK</th>
<th align="left">MESSAGE</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">&lt;= -10</td>
<td>extremely unlucky</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">-9 to -5</td>
<td>very unlucky</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">-4 to -1</td>
<td>unlucky</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td>luck is zero (debug mode only)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">1 to 4</td>
<td>lucky</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">5 to 9</td>
<td>very lucky</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">&gt;= 10</td>
<td>extremely lucky</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Your bonus luck -- and whether your base luck will return to its
baseline level -- is controlled by luckstones and certain Quest
Artifacts. The effect of these "luckitems" depends on the number in
your main inventory that are blessed, uncursed, and cursed (see
table below). Note that you can't do any better than one blessed
luckitem, so you might as well keep any others in a bag (where they
have no effect) as spares in case your main one is cursed.</p>

<table border="1" summary="Effect of Luck Items" cellpadding="7">
<tr>
<th>NUMBER OF LUCK ITEMS</th>
<th>BAD LUCK</th>
<th>GOOD LUCK</th>
<th>BONUS LUCK</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>None</td>
<td>Times out</td>
<td>Times out</td>
<td>0 (no message)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>More cursed than blessed</td>
<td>No timeout</td>

<td>&#160;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Equal cursed and blessed</td>
<td>No timeout</td>

<tr>

<td>+3 "extra luck"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When you are enlightened about your luck, you are also told if
you have bonus luck and if good/bad luck will not time out.</p>

<p>Base luck is adjusted by each of the events described below. It
cannot be reduced below -10 or increased above +10 beyond the
baseline. In addition, every 600 turns (or 300 if you have the
Amulet of Yendor or have angered your god), your luck will increase
by one if it is less than your baseline luck and bad luck times
out, and your luck will decrease by one if your luck is greater
than your baseline luck and good luck times out. Your baseline luck
is +1 if you started or restored the game during a full moon, -1 if
started/restored on Friday the 13th, and 0 if neither or both.</p>
