<p><a id="cost" name="cost"></a><a id="wgt" name="wgt"></a>Wands
are listed above by increasing price, then alphabetically. The COST
field denotes the base price of each item. WGT specifies the weight
(100 zorkmids weighs 1).</p>

<p><a id="prob" name="prob"></a>Wands comprise 4% of all
randomly-generated items in the main dungeon, 6% in containers, 5%
on the Rogue level, and 8% in hell. PROB is the relative
probability of each subtype. They appear 1/34 cursed, 16/17
uncursed, and 1/34 blessed.</p>

<p><a id="chg" name="chg"></a>The CHG field specifies the maximum
number of charges that a wand normally has. An exclamation (!)
denotes that a wand of wishing may only be recharged once. Wands of
wishing start with 1 to 3 charges; otherwise, the wand starts with
a number of charges at most 4 less than its maximum.</p>

<p>Each time you (z)ap or (E)ngrave with a wand, you use one
charge. A wand with zero charges left has a 1 in 121 chance of
wresting a last charge and then turning to dust each time it is
zapped (this won't happen if the wand was cancelled but not
recharged). Cancelling a wand will make it uncursed and (except for
wands of cancellation) it will get zero charges.</p>

<p>Wands may be recharged by scrolls of charging or by the Platinum
Yendorian Express Card. Previously-recharged wands have a chance of
exploding (up to a maximum of 100% for a 7:x wand or a wand of
wishing); see <a href="scrl-341.html">scrl-341.html</a>. A cursed
scroll will have no effect on a blessed wand or a wand with no
charges; otherwise, "Your &lt;wand&gt; vibrates briefly" and it
gets zero charges. An uncursed scroll will bring the number of
charges to a random number from 1 to a random number between 5 and
the maximum charges shown above (or for a wand of wishing a random
number from 1 to 3); a blessed scroll will bring the number of
charges in the wand to a random number from 5 to the maximum
charges shown above, or for a wand of wishing to three charges. If
it already has that number of charges, it gains one more charge. A
wand of wishing charged beyond three charges will explode. "Your
&lt;wand&gt; &lt;glows/vibrates&gt; briefly." if the new
enchantment is below the maximum; "Your &lt;wand&gt; &lt;glows
blue/vibrates&gt; for a moment." otherwise.</p>

<p><a id="type" name="type"></a>The TYPE of wand denotes the
behavior when it is zapped. NODIR wands do not ask for a direction.
BEAM wands ask for a direction, but do not show a visibly animated
effect when zapped. RAY wands produce a ray which is animated on
the screen; if you are unblind when you zap the wand, you will also
identify that type of wand.</p>

<p>The appearances of wands are randomized from the following
descriptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>glass</li>

<li>balsa</li>

<li>crystal</li>

<li>maple</li>

<li>pine</li>

<li>oak</li>

<li>ebony</li>

<li>marble</li>

<li>tin</li>

<li>brass</li>

<li>copper</li>

<li>silver</li>

<li>platinum</li>

<li>iridium</li>

<li>zinc</li>

<li>aluminum</li>

<li>uranium</li>

<li>iron</li>

<li>steel</li>

<li>hexagonal</li>

<li>short</li>

<li>runed</li>

<li>long</li>

<li>curved</li>

<li>forked</li>

<li>spiked</li>

<li>jeweled</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="zap" name="zap"></a>Zapping wands</h2>

<p>Nondirectional wands will be identified if you saw their effect
(e.g., you found a secret door with a wand of secret door
detection). If the wand produces a visible ray or beam, you will
identify the wand if you were unblind. The range of a RAY will be 7
to 13 squares; this range may be lessened by the ray causing
effects or bouncing. Zapping a RAY wand upwards or downwards is
equivalent to restricting the ray to a range of 1. BEAM wands have
a range of 6 to 13 (other than digging), which can similarly be
lessened, and will not bounce; they will be identified if you
observe an effect caused by them.</p>

<p>Cursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding when zapped; this
does 1 to 6 points of damage for each charge in the wand, plus an
additional 2 to 12 points of damage, and abuses your strength.</p>

<p>Monsters are not angered by wands of digging, locking, nothing,
opening, probing, or undead turning (if not undead and none of
their inventory was affected); being zapped with (or missed by)
other wands will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile if you
were the zapper.</p>

 Known, closed doors will be destroyed; secret doors and diggable
walls will be converted into empty doorways; diggable stone into
open corridor spaces.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The door is razed!" (closed door)
<br />
 "The wall glows then fades." (undiggable wall)

<h2><a id="engrave" name="engrave"></a>Engraving with wands</h2>

<p>Use the (E)ngrave command to engrave with a wand. It will use
one charge (possibly wresting the last) from the wand. Depending on
the type of the wand, you can get one of the messages below if you
are unblinded, not levitating, and over a writable floor. Some
messages are the same for different types of wands, some messages
require an engraving already on that square, and some wands will
not provide any means of identification this way. Nondirectional
wands will act as if they were zapped. If you didn't wrest the last
charge from the wand, you can write a message in the dust (or
engrave if specified below). These messages provide (perhaps in
combination with judicious zapping) a safe method of identifying
many wands.</p>
