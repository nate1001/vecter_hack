<h2><a id="sit" name="sit"></a>Sitting on a throne</h2>

<p>(Adapted from a spoiler by Kevin Hugo.)</p>

<p>There is a 2/3 chance that nothing happens.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel somehow out of place..."
<br />
 "You feel very comfortable here." (polymorphed into royal
monster)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, there is an equal 1/13 chance of one of the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You lose d4+2 points from a random attribute, and d10 hit
points. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>&lt;Usual attribute-loss message&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>You gain 1 point to a random attribute. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>&lt;Usual attribute-gain message&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If shock resistant, you lose d6 hit points. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"An electric shock shoots through your body!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, you lose d30 hit points.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"A massive electric shock shoots through your body!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both cases, your constitution is abused. Items in inventory
are NOT at risk of explosion.</p>
</li>

<li>If you are within 5 hit points of maximum, your max HP is
increased by 4; hit points are then restored to maximum whether
increased or not. 
<p>Also cures all blindness, all sickness, and wounded legs.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel much, much better!"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If you have any gold in your main inventory, it's all taken
away. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You notice you have no gold!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, no effect.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel a strange sensation."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If your luck is d5 or more below zero, your luck is increased
by one. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel your luck is changing."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, you get to make a wish.</p>
</li>

<li>d10 throneroom monsters appear around you. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Thy audience hath been summoned, &lt;Sire/Dame&gt;!"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>You get to genocide one species, as for an uncursed scroll of
genocide. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"A voice echoes: "By thy Imperious order,
&lt;Sire/Dame&gt;...""</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If your luck is positive, you are blinded for 249 to 349 (more)
turns; otherwise, your inventory is randomly cursed (as for a
"malignant aura"). 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"A curse upon thee for sitting upon this most holy throne!"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If your luck is non-negative and you don't already have
intrinsic see invisible, you acquire that intrinsic. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Your vision becomes clear."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, if the level can be magic-mapped, it is.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"An image forms in your mind."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, if the level cannot be mapped, you are confused for d30
(more) turns.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"A terrible drone fills your head!"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If you have negative luck, you wake all monsters on the level. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel threatened."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, you are teleported within the level.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You feel a wrenching sensation."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>You can identify items from your inventory: 
<table summary="chance of identifying items" border="1"
cellpadding="7">
<tr>
<td># items:</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>all</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>chance:</td>
<td>1/5</td>
<td>1/5</td>
<td>1/5</td>
<td>1/5</td>
<td>1/5</td>
</tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>"You are granted an insight."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>You are confused for 15+d7 (more) turns. 
<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Your mind turns into a pretzel!"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether anything happened or not, if you are still sitting on
the throne (haven't teleported away), there is a 1/3 chance that
the throne will then disappear.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The throne vanishes in a puff of logic."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a id="kick" name="kick"></a>Kicking a throne</h2>

<p>If you have negative luck, or the throne has previously been
looted, there is a 1/3 chance of destroying the throne, leaving
behind d200 gold pieces.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"CRASH! You destroy the throne."
<br />
 "CRASH! You destroy it." (if blind)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the throne is not destroyed in this manner, you have positive
luck, and the throne has not previously been looted, there is a 1/3
chance of dislodging some loot: 200 to 500 gold pieces, and a
number (more with higher luck) of gems.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"You kick loose some ornamental coins and gems!"
<br />
 "You kick something loose!" (if blind)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If neither of the above effects occur, there is a 1/4 chance
that you may trigger a (hidden, and untriggerable any other way)
trap door.</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"The floor opens up under you!" followed by "The hole in the
ceiling above you closes up."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you didn't get any of the above, you get a hurt foot; your
dexterity and strength, are abused, 1/3 chance of your right leg
being hurt for 5 to 10 turns, and you lose 5 HP (3 HP if your
constitution is greater than 15).</p>

<blockquote class="dl">
<p>"Ouch! That hurts!"</p>
</blockquote>
