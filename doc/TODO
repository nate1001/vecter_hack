Goals
=====

*   Item power should be well understood by players.
    Code should also reflect this to be well understood by coders.
    Items should use dice rolls that are not subverted by tricky code.

*   Game should have graphics. Strategy turn based will be key but upon movement
    there should be a little eye candy.

*   Game will use config files for item / monster generation. Config files will not
    determine how prevalent an item is. This will be done by the game using some metric,
    i.e. for weapons -- average damage roll.

*   Game will use SVG files for graphics. These will be in some specified format.
