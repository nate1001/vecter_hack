Goals
=====

*   Item power should be well understood by players.
    Code should also reflect this to be well understood by coders.
    Items should use dice rolls that are not subverted by tricky code.

*   Game should have graphics. Strategy turn based will be key but upon movement
    there should be a little eye candy.

*   Game will use config files for item / monster generation. Config files will not
    determine how prevalent an item is. This will be done by the game using some metric,
    i.e. for weapons -- average damage roll.

*   Game will use SVG files for graphics. These will be in some specified format.

*   The first version will be based around Nethack. 

    It will impliment behavier and NOT code.
    Nethack has a long and storied history and as such has much Ancient code in it. Features
    that came about later were never dreamed of in the original versions (and no computer would
    have the speed run it anyways.) It is writen in old-timey C where function signatures were
    considered cutting edge (look it up) and indenting your code wasted valuable screen space. Floating point
    numbers were considered the work of the devil, while bit-shifiting was the path to heaven.
    (I've even seen unions in bitshifts. WTF!)
