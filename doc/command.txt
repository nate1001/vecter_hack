Saving and Exiting Commands
===========================

Save and Quit ('Ctrl-X')
  To save your game so that you can return to it later, use this command.
  Save files will also be generated (hopefully) if the game crashes due to
  a system error. After you die, you can use your savefile to play again
  with the same options and such.

Save ('Ctrl-S')
  This command saves the game but doesn't exit Angband. Use this frequently
  if you are paranoid about having your computer crash (or your power go
  out) while you are playing.

Quit (commit suicide) ('Q')
  Kills your character and exits Angband. You will be prompted to make sure
  you really want to do this, and then asked to verify that choice. Note
  that dead characters are dead forever.

User Pref File Commands
=======================

Interact with options ('=')
  Allow you to interact with options. Note that using the "cheat" options
  may mark your savefile as unsuitable for the high score list. The
  "window" options allow you to specify what should be drawn in any of the
  special sub-windows (not available on all platforms). See the help files
  'customize.txt' and 'options.txt' for more info. You can also interact
  with keymaps under this menu.

Interact with keymaps - option submenu
  Allow you to interact with keymaps. You may load or save keymaps from
  user pref files, or define keymaps. You must define a "current action",
  shown at the bottom of the screen, before you attempt to use any of the
  "create macro" commands, which use that "current action" as their action.
 
Interact with visuals - option submenu
  Allow you to interact with visuals. You may load or save visuals from
  user pref files, or modify the attr/char mappings for the monsters,
  objects, and terrain features. You must use the "redraw" command ('^R')
  to redraw the map after changing attr/char mappings. NOTE: It is
  generally easier to modify visuals via the "knowledge" menus.

Interact with colors - option submenu
  Allow the user to interact with colors. This command only works on some
  systems. NOTE: It is commonly used to brighten the 'Light Dark' color
  (eg. Cave Spiders) on displays with bad alpha settings.

Help Commands
=============

Help ('?')
  Brings up the Angband on-line help system. Note that the help files are
  just text files in a particular format, and that other help files may be
  available on the Net. In particular, there are a variety of spoiler files
  which do not come with the standard distribution. Check the place you got
  Angband from or ask on the angband forums angband.oook.cz about them.

Identify Symbol ('/')
  Use this command to find out what a character stands for. For instance,
  by pressing '/.', you can find out that the '.' symbol stands for a
  floor spot. When used with a symbol that represents creatures, the this
  command will tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands for,
  not give you specific information about a creature you can see. To get
  that, use the Look command.

  There are three special symbols you can use with the Identify Symbol
  command to access specific parts of your monster memory. Typing
  'Ctrl-A' when asked for a symbol will recall details about all
  monsters, typing 'Ctrl-U' will recall details about all unique
  monsters, and typing 'Ctrl-N' will recall details about all non-unique
  monsters.

  If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want to
  recall details. If you answer yes, information about the creatures you
  have encountered with that symbol is shown in the Recall window if
  available, or on the screen if not. You can also answer 'k' to see the
  list sorted by number of kills, or 'p' to see the list sorted by 
  dungeon level the monster is normally found on. Pressing 'ESCAPE' at 
  any point will exit this command.

Game Version ('V')
  This command will tell you what version of Angband you are using. For
  more information, see the 'version.txt' help file.

Extra Commands
==============

Toggle Choice Window ('^E')
  Toggles the display in any sub-windows (if available) which are
  displaying your inventory or equipment.

Redraw Screen ('^R')
  This command adapts to various changes in global options, and redraws all
  of the windows. It is normally only necessary in abnormal situations,
  such as after changing the visual attr/char mappings, or enabling
  "graphics" mode.

Load screen dump (left-paren)
  This command loads a "snap-shot" of the current screen from the file
  'dump.txt', and displays it on the screen.

Save screen dump (|')'|)
  This command dumps a "snap-shot" of the current screen to the file
  'dump.txt', including encoded color information. The command has three
  variants:

  - text, a simple ascii dump of the screen concatenated with a dump of the
    color attributes.  It may be viewed in color with the '(' command.
  - html, suitable for viewing in a web browser.
  - forum embedded html for vBulletin, suitable for pasting in
    web forums like http://angband.oook.cz/forums.
	
Special Keys
============
 
Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.

If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt
Angband. The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, ince the
fifth will quit the game, after killing your character. Also, 'Ctrl-Z'
will suspend the game, and return you to the original command shell, until
you resume the game with the 'fg' command. There is now a compilation
option to force the game to prevent the "double 'ctrl-z' escape death
trick". The 'Ctrl-\\' and 'Ctrl-D' and 'Ctrl-S' keys should not be
intercepted.

It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.

Pressing backslash ('\\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an "underlying command" key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. For example, the sequence '\\' + '.' + '6' will always
mean "run east", even if the '.' key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.

The '0' and '^' and '\\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no "useful" way to specify any of them as
an "underlying command", which is okay, since they would have no effect.

For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will abort
the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or 'n', or
'ESCAPE'. The '-more-' message prompts may be cleared (after reading
the displayed message) by pressing 'ESCAPE', 'SPACE', 'RETURN',
'LINEFEED', or by any keypress, if the "quick_messages" option is turned
on.
 
Command Counts
==============

Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them
with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until
you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as
being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another
creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to
be repeated will flash by on the line at the bottom of the screen.

To give a count to a command, type '0', the repeat count, and then the
command. If you want to give a movement command and you are using the
original command set (where the movement commands are digits), press space
after the count and you will be prompted for the command.

Counted commands are very useful for time consuming commands, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also
terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any
character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a 'SPACE' 
or 'ESCAPE' which are always ignored as commands in case you type the
command just after the count expires.
